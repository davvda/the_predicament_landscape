<h2>Unpaid important labour</h2>
<p>While Adam Smith, the "Father of Capitalism", wrote "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest" he lived with his mother who cared, cooked, and cleaned for him with, I wonder, only a regard to her own interest? <strong>Much important work goes unpaid and much unimportant work goes highly paid</strong>. When progress in equality means both men and women can spend more time working for others and less time caring for their family and local community there must've been a fork in the road when we weren't looking.</p>
