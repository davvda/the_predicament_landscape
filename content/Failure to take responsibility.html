<title>Failure to take responsibility</title>
<h2>Failure to take responsibility</h2>
<p>How are we failing to take responsibility? Why should we be held accountable for our actions at all? <strong>Having responsibility is having an obligation to respond for what one has done</strong>. Every externally affecting action, which means all actions, should come with a promise back to the source of that action. Since we live in endlessly complex and intricate webs of causality in the modern world it is increasingly difficult to take responsibility and to even know and understand what to take responsibility for. How should you be responsible for the emissions of the airplane you're travelling in? What about the food served on the plane, the titanium alloys used in manufacturing it, the noise of the engines, the price of your ticket contributing to the continuing unquestioned existence of airlines, etc. There is a blurry line here. When you cross this line you enter the infinite fields of karmic complexity. Karmic complexity does not necessarily belong in this predicament. But maybe it does.</p>

<p>In the 70s I suggested that it would change and it would have to change fast. I was wrong. I did not believe so many people could be so tolerant of nonsense. I did not believe we would remain so morally tolerant. Tolerant but not innocent.<br>
- Ivan Illich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Largely, I believe the responsibility for many predicaments comes down, not to individuals, but institutions, corporations, and, most of all, human-created systems. As long as our systems fail to take responsibility for their externalities we will not manage this landscape. To be even more concrete, this isn't even a question of nuance and detail, it can be as simple as taking responsibility for one's own shit, literally and figuratively.</p>
