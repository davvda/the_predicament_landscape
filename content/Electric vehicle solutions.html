<title>Electric vehicle solutions</title>
<h2>Electric vehicle solutions</h2>
<p>Electric vehicles are vehicles that use electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles are potentially much more efficient than vehicles relying on fossil fuels but they come with other problems. Moving away from fossil fuel-dependent vehicles is of high importance but <strong>electric vehicles are often the right answer to the wrong question</strong>. Electric cars are not mainly meant to save the climate, they're meant to save the car industry. As with all predicaments we must consider where electric vehicle solutions fit in with the rest of the landscape. Beware of good solutions to the wrong problems.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Lack of quiet spaces.html">Lack of quiet spaces</a></strong> - Electric motors aren't as loud as combustion engines but at moderate to high speeds most of the noise from cars come from the friction between the tires and the road. In short, the promise of electric vehicles making our environment quieter was never intended to be upheld.
