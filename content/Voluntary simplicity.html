<title>Voluntary simplicity</title>
<h2>Voluntary simplicity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak the truth.<br>
Speak it loud and often, calmly but insistently,<br>
and speak it, as the Quakers say, to power.<br>
Material accumulation is not the purpose of human existence.<br>
All growth is not good.<br>
The environment is a necessity, not a luxury.<br>
There is such a thing as enough.</p>
<br>Donella Meadows</p>
