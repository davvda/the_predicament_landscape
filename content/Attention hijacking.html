<title>Attention hijacking</title>
<h2>Attention hijacking</h2>
<p><strong>Attention hijacking means getting someone's attention through force or trickery.</strong> It is one of the most seemingly harmless but detrimental crimes against human minds that is accepted as normal in our modern world.</p>
<p>Attention is not merely a passive act. It is a creative one. What we choose to pay attention to is what will spring up out of new sources. What we choose to ignore will wither and die. The dominating culture of our time is a culture obsessed with doing. If we're not doing something we're not doing anything. I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the economies of attention to instead <em>attend, tend to, and show tenderness</em> to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention.</p>

Of course, there is always a selection involved but it is surely preferable that you've done the selection at some point in the forming of opinions?

	<li><strong><a href="Disinformation.html">Disinformation</a></strong> - False information is often more eye-catching. Consequently, in a battle over people's attention there is then an incentive to hijack attention through whatever information does that best.

And I'm not talking Jean-Luc Godard, cool Parisians smoking cigarettes in a back alley café. What am I talking? A chessboard? No, more like TV static. In Swedish we would call that static "war of the ants". Absolutely enthralling.</li>
