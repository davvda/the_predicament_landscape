<title>Hedonism</title>
<h2>Hedonism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The search for pleasure is circular, repetitive, atemporal. The variety seeking of the spectator, the thrill hunter, the sexually promiscuous, always ends in the same place. It has an end. It comes to the end and has to start over. It is not a journey and return, but a closed cycle, a locked room, a cell.</p>
<br>Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hedonism refers to the prioritisation of pleasure in one's life</strong>, perhaps even the prioritisation of pleasure above anything else. It can and often does include different types of pleasure, from the more obvious sensory pleasures to intellectual, emotional, and spiritual pleasures. Hedonism in and of itself isn't a particularly troublesome predicament, if it is one at all, but rather, it becomes one when, as with many other predicaments, it is increased in scale and prioritised beyond proportion and balance. A life without pleasure, a condition commonly called anhedonia, is not to be desired but a life that only hunts for pleasure tends to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford<em>marshmallow</em>experiment">one-marshmallow</a> solutions and longer term displeasure, at least within the current cultural control systems.</p>
