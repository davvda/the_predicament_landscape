<title>Chasing happiness</title>
<h2>Chasing happiness</h2>
<p><strong>Much misery comes from chasing happiness</strong>. Yet, there are ways of fulfilment we, the people born of modernity, can't even begin to imagine. Are you happy? Does it matter?</p>
<p>Also, happiness is the one great promise of modernity, as long as you chase it within its boundaries, through its own means of chasing.</p>
