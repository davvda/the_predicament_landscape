<blockquote>
<p>The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men.</p>
<br>John F. Kennedy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern civilisation is, even more than in the past, a fight to be the one singular entity that wins over all others. Cultures are diverse, they should be. Most cultures have deep roots in unique places, traditions, art, literature, myths, peoples, and stories and cultural complexity, the depth and breadth of cultures, is needed for humanity's continued existence. Culture wars that attempt to erase other cultures either with the purpose of one culture "winning" or for one single homogenised culture to swallow all others will reduce humanity's complexity, meaning we'll be decreasingly capable of tackling any challenges we face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future.</p>
<br>Albert Camus</p>
