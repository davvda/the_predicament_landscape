<h2>National borders</h2>
<p>Do not mistake the map for the territory. Unless you're dealing with national borders. <strong>National borders are geographical boundaries that separate governments, states, nations, and peoples</strong>. Some are heavily guarded and some are completely unguarded. Some are natural borders consisting of mountains, rivers, oceans, or other landscape features, and some borders are political and largely arbitrary, calligraphied while blindfolded at an after-work party.</p>
