<title>Spiritual metacrisis</title>
<h2>Spiritual metacrisis</h2>
<p>What is spirituality to you? Is it an image of an Indian ascetic rigidly meditating in scorching heat? Is it candles scented with Gwyneth Paltrow's vagina? Whatever it is for you, it is in a state of crisis and this crisis is one of the most widely affecting underlying dynamics of the predicament landscape.</p>
<p>Spiritual practices tend to give the answers to the questions we no longer dare to ask, or maybe it is more accurate to say that spirituality creates the space to live those questions. Why? What for? Who are we? Why are we here? What is life? What does it mean to be conscious, to breathe, to feel, to see, to know, to love, to die?</p>
<p><strong>A spiritual crisis is commonly defined as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_crisis">a form of identity crisis where an individual experiences drastic changes to their meaning system</a></strong>, and I would argue that <strong>the spiritual metacrisis of our time is the disintegration of all meaning systems</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...where there are machines, there are bound to be machine worries; where there are machine worries, there are bound to be machine hearts. With a machine heart in your breast, you've spoiled what was pure and simple; and without the pure and simple, the life of the spirit knows no rest.</p>
<br>Chuang Tzu</p>
