<title>The sublime</title>
<h2>The sublime</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The path is not well understood.<br>
It is not like the path of a great ocean.<br>
The path is not a great mirror, not the Buddha.<br>
The path runs through the Buddha’s heart.<br>
There is no distance,<br>
and there is no time to save the sublime.</p>
<br>nonzense</p>
