<title>Knowledge isn't wisdom</title>
<h2>Knowledge isn't wisdom</h2>
<p>One can know a lot and wholly lack wisdom. Some might sneer at the notion of wisdom, comparing the high seat of knowledge that modern science and reasoning is built upon with the purported "wisdom" of primitive dead peoples. Rest assured that wisdom lies above knowledge as <strong>wisdom entails the direction of action based on knowledge, experience, understanding, and insight</strong>. Knowledge tells us nothing of what to do or why. It is, rather, an awareness of certain stated facts, models, concepts, principles, or explanations. Don't get me wrong, knowledge is of the utmost importance but it is nothing without wisdom. The two should never be confused.</p>
