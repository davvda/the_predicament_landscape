<title>Power concentration to the wrong people</title>
<h2>Power concentration to the wrong people</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I loved when Bush came out and said, 'We are losing the war against drugs.'</p>
<br>You know what that implies? There's a war being fought, and the people on drugs are winning it.</p>
<br>Bill Hicks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an entity to maintain its existence it is vital that, if power is to concentrate, it concentrates in those groups that have the entity's best in mind. The game theory of capitalism where the only way to not lose power is to win it and keep it, increasing one's optionality and agency while the rest of the entity's options are narrowed. More concretely, people with power and money can do anything as long as they keep that power whereas the majority of the entity fall into a treadmill of working to ensure the maintenance of the higher group's power and financial increase.</p>
<p><strong>If one was to design a system that made sure the worst people climbed to the top, it would be something very close to what we've ended up with</strong>. It is vital that we either change some characteristics of our global economic system to ensure the right people are in power or change the hierarchical structure of the system to allow for more decentralised power structures.</p>
