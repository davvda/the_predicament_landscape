<title>Wholeness</title>
<h2>Wholeness</h2>
<p>Duality of non-duality</p>
<p>The union of division with union.</p>
<p>Fractal yin-yang.</p>
<p>Holism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then what is the answer? Not to be deluded by dreams.<br>
To know that great civilisations have broken down into violence,<br>
and their tyrants come, many times before.<br>
When open violence appears, to avoid it with honor or choose<br>
the least ugly faction; these evils are essential.<br>
To keep one’s own integrity, be merciful and uncorrupted<br>
and not wish for evil; and not be duped<br>
By dreams of universal justice or happiness. These dreams will<br>
not be fulfilled.<br>
To know this, and know that however ugly the parts appear<br>
the whole remains beautiful. A severed hand<br>
Is an ugly thing and man dissevered from the earth and stars<br>
and his history … for contemplation or in fact …<br>
Often appears atrociously ugly. Integrity is wholeness,<br>
the greatest beauty is<br>
Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty<br>
of the universe. Love that, not man<br>
Apart from that, or else you will share man’s pitiful confusions,<br>
or drown in despair when his days darken.</p>
<br>Robinson Jeffers</p>
