<title>Lack of masculine and feminine</title>
<h2>Lack of masculine and feminine</h2>
<p><strong>The modern world lacks paths of initiation into woman- and manhood</strong>. Putting any questions of binary gender and sex aside, there are clear difficulties in finding one's role in societies where positive feminine and masculine archetypes are missing.</p>
<p>Importantly, it is also important for men to understand the meaning of womanhood and vice versa. Woman- and manhood are complementary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin<em>and</em>yang">not opposing</a>, forces. It is only in the joining of dualities that new wholeness, new life, is created.</p>
