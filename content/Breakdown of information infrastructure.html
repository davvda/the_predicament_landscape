<h2>Breakdown of information infrastructure</h2>

<p>The algorithmic recommendation systems of the internet in general and social media in particular is leading to a breakdown in information infrastructure, <strong>hindering the flow of truthful information</strong> in favour of whatever stirs emotion and increases engagement and retention. Modern informational systems rely on capturing and holding attention in order to stay financially competitive. These incentives are detrimental to our information infrastructures. Further, the way we gather information about the world has failed to keep up with modernity's exponential increase in complexity.</p>

But then again, I might just be too much of an idealist. Even this landscape is too simplified.</li>
