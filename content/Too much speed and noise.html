<title>Too much speed and noise</title>
<h2>Too much speed and noise</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything moves fast cracked highway asphalt flowing bubbling venomous. Your mouth moves. Silent cacophony of voices screaming from exhaustion pipes. Loud static highest gear. Can you hear the sun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things appear to be moving with such speed and it's increasingly difficult to make sense of it through all the noise. Much of the noise comes from us moving rapidly, going nowhere. We miss the changes of the seasons. I wish we would get to nowhere. <strong>Nowhere is slow, nowhere is quiet.</strong></p>

	<li><strong><a href="War.html">War</a></strong> - "Somehow I think that our speed is partly what makes the bombs. I don't think we could do it if we were slower. I really don't. So that's the first part of concentration, just slowing down a little bit, letting things settle, stop waving our arms so much." - Jack Kornfield, Householder Series Talks</li>
