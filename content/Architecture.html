<p>The specific patterns, out of which a building or a town is made<br>
may be alive or dead. To the extent they are alive, they let our inner<br>
forces loose, and, set us free; but when they are dead they keep<br>
us locked in inner conflict.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture is the art and technique of designing human constructions.</strong> It is a field which reaches far into the realms of the practical, pragmatic, and utilitarian, while simultaneously reaching into the depths of aesthetics, beauty, and nature. It is also a field whose reach in one direction is easily measured while the other direction isn't. The forces of modernity will then have its way with architecture and this, among other things, is what has lead modern architecture to become what it currently is. Quoting Encyclopedia Britannica's <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture">article</a> on architecture, you cannot separate the two reaches of architecture, "because every society—settled or nomadic—has a spatial relationship to the natural world and to other societies, the structures they produce reveal much about their environment (including climate and weather), history, ceremonies, and artistic sensibility, as well as many aspects of daily life".</p>
<p>"But", you oppose, "don't we simply have our preferences, our own tastes? You are just another cranky romantic wishing things looked more like in the olden days!". Well, sure. There is a Swedish expression, "smaken är som baken", directly translated as "taste is like the butt", used when expressing that everyone's taste is different because every butt is different. However, most people rarely consider their butts, wipe them sloppily, sit on them too much, and astonishingly few spend time actively developing their butts. Yet I'd argue that most people could identify a well-developed butt. Yes, taste is like the butt, in most people under-developed, forgotten, and something best kept behind cover. What is good or true is not, necessarily, an opinion or a question of taste. There is such a thing as bad taste and just look at people's butts to estimate just how common this bad taste is. That's my opinion at least. I'd give my butt a 6,5/10 but I'm working on it.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Democracy failing.html">Democracy failing</a></strong> - Far-fetched? How our living spaces are designed greatly influences how and if we interact with those around us. The isolation of modern architecture and urban design surely has influence on the ability for the people to rule wisely.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignored externalities.html">Ignored externalities</a></strong> - The consequences and unseen externalities of modern architecture must be vast. What would happen to pre-historic humans forced to live in sterile cubes high above the ground? What does the lack of a free horizon do to us?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of a living world view.html">Lack of a living world view</a></strong> - My opinions on Le Corbusier are varied but if he had<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ville_Contemporaine"> had his way with central Paris</a> all the life of that glorious, piss-filled, croissant-flaked city would've vanished. “A house is a machine for living in.” - Le Corbusier</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of belonging.html">Lack of belonging</a></strong> - Much modern architecture alienates us from the ground that should be our home and the neighbours that should be our people.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of communities.html">Lack of communities</a></strong> - The design of a living space often decides how and if a community can be built within it.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of dark spaces.html">Lack of dark spaces</a></strong> - Modern architecture generally shuns darkness, deems it unsafe. An architect unable to play with darkness and shadows is no architect worthy of the title.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of love.html">Lack of love</a></strong> - You can tell when a structure has been designed with a dose of love and, more importantly, you can tell when love is wholly absent from a structure. “The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes. If you foolishly ignore beauty, you will soon find yourself without it. Your life will be impoverished. But if you invest in beauty, it will remain with you all the days of your life.” - Frank Lloyd Wright</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of the longterm.html">Lack of the longterm</a></strong> - There is undoubtedly a bias or a misunderstanding with regards to the glorification of historical buildings. The old buildings that still stand give the impression that older buildings simply had better construction, higher quality, and better materials. All of this might be true but, thinking for another second, you realise that the bias here is that the only sample that illustrates the quality of old buildings are by definition the old buildings designed and constructed in such a way that they still stand today. There are many old buildings that have been demolished and these simply aren't considered because they no longer exist. However, flipping the coin over, not all old buildings were designed to last but when it comes to modern buildings very few are designed to last particularly long. We simply can't afford to mix quality into our slurry of efficiency, productivity, and speed. And imagine, we believe we're the most advanced and free people in history.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Loneliness.html">Loneliness</a></strong> - Modern architecture has facilitated how easy it is to be lonely.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Mental health.html">Mental health</a></strong> - The human-built environment affects our mental health greatly.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="No value in maintenance.html">No value in maintenance</a></strong> - Most often, it is cheaper and faster to demolish and build something new.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Quality.html">Quality</a></strong> - Architecture directly feeds into our strange confusion and neglect of quality. “When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. But when I’m finished, if the solution is not beautiful I know it’s wrong.” - Buckminster Fuller</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Sameness.html">Sameness</a></strong> - When all architects, willfully or not, optimise for the same things... Well, we end up with the monotonous crap that surrounds us. Architecture, like design and similar fields, used to be an art. It has become simple engineering and development. With some luck the architect might dare or be allowed to have differently sized windows or a colour accent on the facade. Amazing.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Sedentary lifestyles.html">Sedentary lifestyles</a></strong> - The built environment decides how we live and move in it.</li>
