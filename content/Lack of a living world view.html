<title>Lack of a living world view</title>
<h2>Lack of a living world view</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world.</p>
<br>Max Weber</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The view of the world as dead, inanimate, and mechanistic is not particularly congruent with the synergistic, self-regulating, and complex nature of the world as it presents itself to our lived experience</strong>. However, this view makes it easier to justify manipulating its parts. Strapping the plow on the oxen both makes it into, and requires the oxen to be seen as, nothing but a machine. Further, if we see the world as inanimate then our actions cannot kill it because it never lived in the first place. The world is not a collection of <em>dead static things</em>, it is an endless ocean of <em>living flowing streams</em>.</p>
