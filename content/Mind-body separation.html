<title>Mind-body separation</title>
<h2>Mind-body separation</h2>
<p>Let me begin with a left-brained approach to illustrating how at fault we are when we assume ourselves to be minds or brains living in a casing of flesh. The brain consists of neurons and the amount of neurons seem to correlate quite well with an animal's intelligence, in a way. Our gut has more neurons than the brain of a dog. How, then, are your thoughts separated from your "gut feelings"?</p>
<p>I have difficulty even entertaining the thought for longer than I already have in this example. <strong>There is no boundary, no separation, between mind and body</strong>. Even talking about mind and body as separate things shows my own inclination towards distinction. Your body is your mind, your mind is your body, you are both, your mind together with your body is your connection to the world which you are also. Take that and run with it or do what you will.</p>
<p>We inevitably create difficulties for ourselves when we see mind and body as separate and it is, frankly, ridiculous of a supposedly intelligent being to hold such delusions.</p>
