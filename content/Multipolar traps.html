<title>Multipolar traps</title>
<h2>Multipolar traps</h2>
<p>Multipolar traps are some of the most prevalent <strong>generator functions of existential risks</strong> and one of, if not the most difficult challenge humankind has ever faced. But what are multipolar traps? They are game theory power plays. One way to look at multipolar traps is as a variation on the tragedy of the commons, where different entities compete over a resource and through their own self-interest deplete the resource for themselves and everyone else. The reason for this happening is that if there is enough resources around for everyone it only requires one entity being slightly greedy for everyone else to be incentivised to do the same in order to ensure their own survival. So, since our entity is "good" we should, before all this happens, trust in our understanding of game theory and extract as much of that resource as we can so we can ensure that the other entities don't do it first. It was simply the right thing to do. Game theory-wise, and tragedy of the commons-wise. Raise this behaviour up a notch and include exponential power and technology and you have multipolar traps.</p>
<p>I don't believe a single person in the world feels stoked about the existence of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ejROOyHW0">AI-controlled nuclear drones, yet every major military power is developing them as fast as they possibly can</a>. We are stuck in a race to become the one entity that survives. And now, since this race requires different types of vital resources, has become global, and is driven by such power, we might slowly come to realise, I hope, that what we are racing towards is to become the first entity to destroy everything. <strong>If we do not figure out how to solve multipolar traps, acquire the wisdom to manage them, these traps will guarantee the complete collapse of civilisation and the extinction of most life on Earth</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the negative cascade effects that can arise out of the connections in the Predicament Landscape are multipolar traps and it is therefore of the highest importance to develop an understanding for both the interconnectedness and interdependence of different predicaments.</p>
