<h2>Travel</h2>
<p><strong>Travel is the movement of people across space between different geographical locations</strong>. It has never been as easy to travel as in modern times. It is so easy that travel is often seen as almost a right, a right to experience the world and go anywhere one wants. It is a difficult predicament. Travel might be the best way for humans to learn about the world and about other people. However, the more people can travel and the more globalised the world becomes one can go to the other side of the world and not really travel anywhere. How do we facilitate travel while keeping cultural and geographical diversity? How far does one have to go to travel?</p>

<p>We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.</p>
