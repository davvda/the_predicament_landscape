<title>Ego</title>
<h2>Ego</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Wear your ego like a loose fitting garment.</p>
<br>Gautama Buddha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ego, the small self, the self-centered illusory center-self, the motivator of self-serving actions, the "I" that wants and desires, the separate "me", the voice that asks "what's in it for me?", the mental chatter you think is yours and you. <strong>The ego claims to be and justifies <em>the self</em></strong>. Ego dynamics lie at the bottom of many predicaments and, if we don't learn to understand the ego for what it is, it will rule us to ruin.</p>
