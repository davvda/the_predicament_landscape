<h2>Car-centric design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people; design is made for people.</p>
<br> - Dieter Rams</p>

<p><strong>Many cities are designed for cars</strong>. As with many predicaments, car-centric design has a complex and recursive causality chain. The more common it is to have a car, the further the distances between shops, workplaces, etc, and the further the distances are the more common it'll be to have a car. Car-centric design has ruined and is ruining our villages, cities, countries, and much of the world and, frankly, makes the world a better place for cars than for humans.</p>
<p>Christopher Alexander et al. write in A Pattern Language, "The problems stem essentially from the fact that a car is so much bigger than a person. Large parking lots, suited for the cars, have all the wrong properties for people. They are too wide; they contain too much pavement; they have no place to linger. In fact, we have noticed that people speed up when they are walking through large parking lots to get out of them as fast as possible". What does their research suggest is a large parking lot, you ask? One that fits more than seven cars. Seven.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond a certain speed, motorized vehicles create remoteness which they alone can shrink. They create distances for all and shrink them for only a few.</p>

I challenge anyone to live their life in a mall parking lot and stay sane. Though, if you accepted that challenge you've already failed its premise.</li>
