<title>Educational crisis</title>
<h2>Educational crisis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the essential, the what is; and to awaken this capacity, in oneself and in others, is education.</p>
<br>J. Krishnamurti</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills and traits</a></strong> and means <em>to bring forth</em>. A crisis of education is therefore the potential or actual failure of this transmission and the failure to bring forth humans with the knowledge, skills, and traits needed to find their way in the world. Informal education's role has decreased while the increased role of formal education has narrowed to the point where much necessary knowledge and understanding requires an unlearning of one's formal education. Education, both formal and informal, is necessary for the prevailing of cultures but its current effects aren't just decreasingly constructive, they're also increasingly destructive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence.</p>
<br>Maria Montessori</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - If there is one dominating link for the predicament of educational crises, it is this one. The standard education of modernity surely has its merits but the chasm between what it makes us ready for and what it should be expected to make us ready for is so wide that no formal education at all is likely a better path towards maturity. Even though I say this with confidence I am not certain of the exact reasons. Perhaps it lies in my feeling that schooling narrows the mind, reduces and simplifies, condenses too aggressively, curates and makes everything explicit. All of this leads to a necrosis of the mental musculature that assumes and allows complexity, the implicit, vague or no boundaries, nuanced thinking. The connection between educational crisis and complexity mismatch goes deep and I am barely scratching its surface layer.</li>

It creates mentally and emotionally unbalanced people with a complete lack of depth and nuance in their view of the world. It does this through atrophying those traits inherent in children which gives them the intuition for the world being infinite, magic, full of wonder, complex, and alive. Mental models that mechanises the world can be useful but what we've done is created a system of teaching which pushes minds into the mechanised model, shuts the lid, and locks them inside.</li>
