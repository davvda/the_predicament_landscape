<title>Lack of cultural control systems</title>
<h2>Lack of cultural control systems</h2>
<p>Wisdom, spirituality, animism, and elders have contributed historically to creating <strong>cultural control systems which, as opposed to laws, control behaviours with an open hand.</strong> Modernity mostly lacks cultural control systems since they have been replaced by game theory. When people mention the need for religion, "a new christianity", or a complete destruction of capitalism, I believe the foundational discussion that must be had is one of cultural control systems in general. A faulty control system will lead to complete lack of cultural balance, an absence of any control system whatsoever is unbounded chaos.</p>
