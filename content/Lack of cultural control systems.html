<title>Lack of cultural control systems</title>
<h2>Lack of cultural control systems</h2>
<p>Alternative names: soft control, vernacular control systems.</p>
<p>Wisdom, spirituality, animism, and elders have contributed historically to creating <strong>cultural control systems which, as opposed to laws, control behaviours with an open hand.</strong> Modernity mostly lacks cultural control systems as these have been replaced by game theory. When people mention the need for religion, "a new christianity", or a complete destruction of capitalism, I believe the foundational discussion that must be had is one of cultural control systems in general. A faulty control system will lead to complete lack of cultural balance, an absence of any control system whatsoever is unbounded chaos. Furthermore, calling it a "control system" gets the point across as to what it might result in but doesn't hint strongly enough at the freedom and openness of this type of control. For example, a feeling of shame after an unwholesome act can be part of a cultural control system.</p>
<p>Would it be more fruitful to talk of vernacular control or subtle control systems? A shared conscience, cultural expectations and standards, vectors with a light and delicate controlling power shaping the flow of people's behaviour, almost a vague cultural etiquette? Why must we always be so explicit?</p>

	<li><a href="Bullshit jobs.html">Bullshit jobs</a> - Not only do we lack the cultural control systems which actively discourage pointless jobs, we wander around in a delusional haze where we encourage and respect those whose jobs are pointless. Is your job cleaning or cooking? Oh, I'm sorry. Do you manage the cloud infrastructure for a business' sales data pipeline? Wow, what have you prepared for your next conference presentation?

	<li><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a> - The complexity of decentralised cultural control systems compared with centralised forms of power and control could make up an entire book in itself, and I'm sure it has. Just to be clear, in case you've forgotten, the argument here isn't one or the other. It is an argument about balance.</li>

	<li><a href="Democracy failing.html">Democracy failing</a> - One can argue it has long since failed already. All ruling power of the people, along with cultural control systems, have largely been replaced with centralised control structures, game theory as capitalism, business oligopolies and oligarchies, and general nonsensical power struggles.</li>
