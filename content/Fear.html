<title>Fear</title>
<h2>Fear</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all base passions, fear is the most accursed.</p>
<br>William Shakespeare</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear">Fear is an intensely unpleasant primal emotion in response to perceiving or recognising a danger or threat</a></strong> and commonly leads to fight-or-flight reactions of different degrees. Importantly, thought influences our perception of what is or isn't a threat and our thoughts are further influenced by everything and everyone around us. Our complex modern surroundings lead to threats and dangers being less clear than in the primitive setting, where fear evolved, and therefore risks fear and its reactive behaviours becoming less congruent with reality. Another important note is that fear itself is rarely the problem. It is rather our perception of the world that can get muddied and generate fear where none is reasonable and vice versa. This is especially true when votes and wealth can be gained through instilling fear in others.</p>
