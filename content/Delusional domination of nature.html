<title>Delusional domination of nature</title>
<h2>Delusional domination of nature</h2>
<p>The delusional domination of nature results in a world where we can build beautiful steel bridges over deep ravines while burning all other bridges, make animals into cattle and forcing them into cramped spaces and then justifying treating humans similarly. This is, of course, not strange, for we aren't separate from nature and <strong>any domination of nature will therefore bind us into submission as well</strong>. Then again, if you're into shibari I say go for it. Did we ever agree on a safeword, by the way?</p>
