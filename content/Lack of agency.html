<h2>Lack of agency</h2>

<p>How wonderful it is that nobody needs to wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.</p>

<p><strong>Agency is the capacity to act</strong>, <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency">to effectively set in motion, powerfully incite action</a>. From the smallest scale of single human decisions to decisions on planetary scale, we often seem to lack agency or, at the very least, lack a belief in our agency. Agency is also, more specifically, <a href="https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency">the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you</a>. It is, in other words, independent from the direct context and events of your situation. You can always increase your agency in some way, find how and where you're capable of action.</p>
<p>If nothing else, learning to accept situations where you experience a lack of agency can lead to an internal agency of thought that suddenly changes everything. There are no moments that completely lack agency, you just have to notice it.</p>
