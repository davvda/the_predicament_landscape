<h2>Lack of agency</h2>

<p>How wonderful it is that nobody needs to wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.</p>

<p><strong>Agency is the capacity to act</strong>, <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency">to effectively set in motion, powerfully incite action</a>. From the smallest scale of single human decisions to decisions on planetary scale, we often seem to lack agency or, at the very least, lack a belief in our agency. Agency is also, more specifically, <a href="https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency">the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you</a>. It is, in other words, independent from the direct context and events of your situation. You can always increase your agency in some way, find how and where you're capable of action.</p>
<p>If nothing else, learning to accept situations where you experience a lack of agency can lead to an internal agency of thought that suddenly changes everything. There are no moments that completely lack agency, you just have to notice it.</p>

	<li><a href="Parenting.html">Parenting</a> - Time to add nuance to my hate of institutions... When it comes to parental leave, at least some institution-heavy nations are doing a decent job. My daughter is currently five months old and I was home for her first two months and am now working 50%, most of which is remote work from my home office. My wife has been home with her until now when she's started working 20%. The plan is for our daughter to start going to open kindergarten play time whenever she expresses interest in it. Otherwise we have no need of help outside of the occasional grandparent taking over for a few hours. We're not missing anything and neither is our daughter, she just experienced her first snow with two relaxed parents walking into town for a coffee. Hearing stories about new parents in the US, great states of modernity, me and my wife have heard about parents having to go back to work within the first month or two of the baby's life, putting it in kindergarten around the age of seven weeks. Absolute utter insanity. Madness. Then again, in Sweden it would be illegal of us to homeschool whereas in the US you do whatever the fuck you want and face the consequences.</li>
