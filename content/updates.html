<h3>2025-11-10 Different Times</h3>
<p>Having become a father of a four month old little wonder <strong>this project has been put in the backseat for a while</strong>. However, it's still along for the ride and on some early mornings when everyone's asleep I chip away at the links and link motivations. More then halfway now. Just as expected it's taking longer than I expected. I'm eager to start properly writing the Overlay, but the predicaments must be dealt with first.</p>
<p>I sense that I'm part of some larger underlying movement in the world, turning away from the problematic, almost giving up in a positive way, turning towards whatever one wishes to see and create. Perhaps the realisation that whatever one wants to see in the world has no chance of arising in the conventional systems and thought patterns that keep leading us towards already broken promises? I'm not totally sure but I find great optimisim in finally giving up. Instead of staring into the flames, despair burning in my lungs, desperately trying to save it all, constantly trying to draw people's attention to just how fucked everything is, how screwed <em>we</em> are, wanting others to see deeply what I see, suffer along with me, no, instead of all that, turning away from the flames, <strong>towards something that isn't exclusively defined by what it is not</strong>.</p>
<p>My gaze has been turned but I still need a bit more time to connect and describe what's been seen in the flames. It's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Now, writing directly to <strong>the state of this project</strong>. If you're reading this you're seeing an updated version of The Predicament Landscape which includes what I've managed to produce so far. 250 predicaments, half of which have connections and motivations, approximately 250 overlay points not yet written, with varying degrees of content, mostly for my own remembering, research them yourself if you feel inclined. Much remains but much is also in place. However, I do believe the finished landscape will provide material for a more holistic perspective from which further insights can be revealed.</p>
<p>While you're here, check out some of the Overlay points that have some content added, such as <strong><a href="Attention.html">Attention</a></strong>, <strong><a href="Acceptance.html">Acceptance</a></strong>, <strong><a href="New life.html">New life</a></strong>, <strong><a href="Quit your job.html">Quit your job</a></strong>, <strong><a href="The sublime.html">The sublime</a></strong>, <strong><a href="Wholeness.html">Wholeness</a></strong>, <strong><a href="Zen.html">Zen</a></strong>. Slightly more inspiring and hopeful than the predicaments, don't you think? But then again, the light will appear brighter if you've looked deeply into the darkness. Keep working.</p>

<h3>2025-10-10 Insights from the Landscape</h3>
<p>Continuous and arbitrary. But not quite, not completely, not all the way through. It has now been a while since I started mapping this landscape. What is this landscape? What does it have to say? Isn't it simply a long list of problems? I have no clear conclusion but I have arrived at the borders of certain vague and diffuse insights, some of which I will attempt to explain here, mostly for the purpose of making the thoughts more explicit and communicable.</p>
<h4>Continuous and almost arbitrary</h4>
<p>My wife once said that nothing turns me on more than recursion. Almost a year ago now, I was walking to the gym when a thought, most likely obvious to any researcher of complex systems, struck me as profoundly true. I had just read about the concept of universality classes, categorisations of complex systems that allow them to be mathematically modelled in a simpler way than their complexity on other scales might suggest. To be fully transparent, my intellect is not structured in a way that allows me to understand much of what I've read about universality classes or complex systems theory. However, the thought that struck me was that flowing up and down in scale, zooming in and out, every possible universality class would pop up and, most importantly, even when zooming in or out <strong>infinitely</strong>, the behaviour of systems and subsystems at particular scales will fall within a <strong>finite</strong> amount of universality classes. Let me give an example that might illuminate. Some systems flow like spirals. Galaxies, whirlpools, subatomic particles. Same universality class, very different in scale. Zoom into parts of galaxies and you might find clusters or repeating patterns that are then found again at smaller or larger scales, perhaps not just in space but also in the scale of time, I don't know. So, okay, flowing continuously through scales there are to be found certain specific behaviours and process patterns whose amount is finite. Cool. How is this relevant? Well, take that piece of the puzzle, feel its weight and we'll soon return to it.</p>
<h4>Christopher Alexander's Centers</h4>
<p>The main source of inspiration for the structure of the predicament landscape is Christopher Alexander et al's A Pattern Language, a book consisting of 250-ish architectural patterns. Alexander's The Nature of Order tried to further generalise the philosophy behind the patterns through a concept he calls centers.</p>
<img src="img/rugs.png" width="100%">
<p>Christopher Alexander fucking <em>loves</em> rugs.</p>
<p>A center is "an organized zone of space � which, because of its internal coherence, and because of its relation to context � forms a local zone of relative centeredness with respect to the other parts of space". In the example of an A4 paper with a dot drawn on it there are many centers. The horizontal segments bounded by the dot, the vertical segments bounded by the dot, the four quadrants created by the dot, the entire paper, the dot itself, a certain area around the dot itself, and the list could go on. Alexander believes that a deep understanding of centers is crucial for architects to create places that sustain thiving human life. Taking this even further, I believe centers touch on something that is crucial for anyone to understand in order to create anything that sustains thriving human life, or perhaps even creates it from the very start. <strong>A wholeness consisting of centers which positively intesify each other creates coherence and profound beauty</strong>. In the first book of The Nature of Order Alexander lays out fifteen fundamental properties of how centers intensify each other:</p>
<ol>
<li>Levels of scale</li>
<li>Strong centers</li>
<li>Boundaries</li>
<li>Alternating repetition</li>
<li>Positive space</li>
<li>Good shape</li>
<li>Local symmetries</li>
<li>Deep interlock and ambiguity</li>
<li>Contrast</li>
<li>Gradients</li>
<li>Roughness</li>
<li>Echoes</li>
<li>The void</li>
<li>Simplicity and inner calm</li>
<li>Not-separateness</li>
</ol>
<p>If you, like me, first respond with a feeling of discomfort at how "subjective" much of this is, I urge you to, like I ended up doing, look more into phenomenology as a philosophical field to get a better understanding of why expressions like "<em>good</em> shape" aren't as subjective as they first appear. Perhaps check out Husserl or Merleau-Ponty. Fuck, where's my Galois and overly frothy cortado? I could go into each of the fifteen properties and explain their relevance but, for now, listing them will suffice. Onward to the next puzzle piece.</p>
<h4>Wendell Berry's Solving for Pattern</h4>
<p>I've hopefully made it clear that I have a problem with the notion of problems, bullet points on a list that require solving until we one day reach the end of the list and arrive at blissful utopia. However, solving or resolving predicaments (or problems if you insist on the word) can be achieved in different ways. Wendell Berry, everybody's favourite farmer grandpa, has some ideas here. There are three types of solutions, "first, the solution that causes a ramifying series of new problems, the only limiting criterion being, apparently, that the new problems should arise beyond the purview of the expertise that produced the solution". <strong>Ignored externalities</strong>, illusion of competence, naive progress narrative, biased evidence selection, failure to take responsibility, ignoring complexity, ignoring diversity, lack of systems thinking, etc, etc. "The second kind of solution", he continues, "is that which immediately worsens the problem it is intended to solve, causing a hellish symbiosis in which problem and solution reciprocally enlarge one another in a sequence that, so far as its own logic is concerned, is limitless". Energy, over-reliance on technology, <strong>growth</strong>, surveillance, monocultures (agriculture), violence, and war. Finally, the third kind of solution is what relates to the predicament landscape and how its pseudospatial aspect becomes interesting in relation to centers and system flow patterns. Commenting on the two kinds of solutions above, Berry writes that "such solutions always involve a definition of the problem that is either false or so narrow as to be virtually false. To define an agricultural problem as if it were solely a problem of agriculture � or solely a problem of production or technology or economics � is simply to misunderstand the problem, either inadvertently or deliberately, either for profit or because of a prevalent fashion of thought. The whole problem must be solved, not just some handily identifiable and simplifiable aspect of it." How, then, does one solve <em>the whole problem</em>? How can one untangle the predicament? The third kind of solution causes "a ramifying series of solutions ... The farmer has put plants and animals into a relationship of mutual dependence, and must perforce be concerned for balance or symmetry, a reciprocating connection in the pattern of the farm that is biological, not industrial, and that involves solutions to problems of fertility, soil husbandry, economics, sanitation - the whole complex of problems whose proper solutions add up to health: the health of the soil, of plants and animals, of farm and farmer, of farm family and farm community, all involved in the same internested, interlocking pattern � or pattern of patterns". Excuse all the quotes but it's all so important. To summarise, Berry writes that "a bad solution is bad, then, because it acts destructively upon the larger patterns in which it is contained" and "a good solution is good because it is in harmony with those larger patterns".</p>
<h4>Solving for Wholeness</h4>
<p>Let us try to summarise even further and also relate it to the predicament landscape. Everything in the universe flows in complex patterns that can be discerned as system models at different scales. These patterns can act as centers that vitally(?) and consciously(?) strengthen, weaken, create, or destroy the surrounding patterns of flow, and every flow pattern's effect (which can be adequately modelled as finite) at every scale further influences the whole (which should always be understood as infinite). Having chosen the scale where around 250 predicaments are discernible, the core question then appears: <strong>which actions within each predicament positively affect the surrounding predicaments in ways that harmonise with our intentions and aspirations? Which landscape overlay can most wisely alter the flow of the predicament landscape in a way that creates a more harmonious wholeness by considering levels of scale, deep interlock and ambiguity, echoes, the void, simplicity and inner calm, and not-separateness?</strong></p>
<h4>Less vague</h4>
<p>If I have to be less vague... The predicament landscape contains a bunch of predicaments, issues, problems, crises, all of which somehow relate to each other. Their interrelated nature is what creates the immense difficulty of avoiding collapse or, more truthfully, to make it through and past ongoing collapse. We need to figure out how to create positive feedback loops that spread through the landscape instead of the constantly compounding negative ones we see currently. This is where the Overlay comes in. The purpose of the overlay is to find positive feedback and compounding effects that can radiate out from each action across the landscape and alter it slightly in a beneficial and hopefully more wise direction. Both the predicaments and the overlays are just guesses taken on hunches and intuition about what is clearly bad or hopefully good, either to directly act on or at least consider. We will always have a predicament landscape but we must work to counter the devastating effects of the current one on our actual landscape and reality. These are just models intended to be helpful in thinking about what to do with your life in this time and place. I believe they've already been useful to me so, with luck, they can be for you as well.</p>
<h4>More vague, more true</h4>
<p>Still, all of the above is still too... intellectual? Analytical? Too much talk about systems, control, solving, fixing. Not enough life. Should I just pick up my Telecaster for a while? We might've moved beyond the point of explanation. <strong>"Cease to do evil, learn to do good. Purify your own mind: that is the teaching of all Buddhas"</strong>. Get to it.</p>

<h3>2025-01-19 Everything will break...</h3>
<p>I don't think you can see it yet. Maybe you can. Somewhere behind the blank dead stare of strangers and friends glad to be unhappy. They're breaking and so are you. Everything stapled onto dreamy castles of dust built on clouds of stale nitrogen nightmares will crack and fall and with so far to fall there's no wonder you see others breaking in the fall, violent explosions of feathers, black and white, and splinters of bone. No bother. Everything will break. One day you will awake and all you know will be undone and when you look around you there will be nothing left except your two feet and the ground to stand on. With luck you'll be there, I'll be there, and we can look up at the blank death of space, the living breathing pulsating milky way sweeping across a blackness filled with nothing but hairpin cracks of light. To my sister, father, mother, wife, Romeo, Hilma, and new life unborn, the only way to mend is for everything to break.</p>
<h3>2025-01-09 Update & Future Work</h3>
<p>The work with this landscape is at a standstill. Certain conditions have lead to me having to focus on applying for jobs and this process seems to zap all energy from me. However, the work proceeds mentally and some aspects of this landscape are becoming clear.</p>
<h4>The Links</h4>
<p>The work that is most pressing is the outgoing links of the predicaments and their motivations. I believe these links are the key for a gestalt of our human predicament to start appearing. Nothing is ever a singular problem in isolation and no solution can be treated as a closed loop. As of writing this there are still 224 predicaments left that require re-linking as well as motivations written for those links. This can be facilitated by a continued work of...</p>
<h4>Metacrisis Categorisation</h4>
<p>Some predicaments fit neatly together like houses in a village, mountains on an island, or nations of a continent. There is an ongoing but non-published process of sorting and categorising predicaments. This serves two functions. Firstly, it's mentally much easier to work in chunks. Secondly, it is crucial for the map-making. See, the map-making, I have changed my approach...</p>
<h4>Mapping the Landscape</h4>
<p>There are two ideas currently floating around and I sense it might be necessary or at least valuable to pursue both. The first is to scrap the tiny part that has been mapped (with a bit too much detail) so far and instead simplify it to something whose landscape is clearly visible but where each predicament appears as a point of interest, similarly to something like this, drawn from the map for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:</p>
<img src="img/skyrim.png" width="100%">
<p>But there is, as mentioned, a second idea, an idea which includes the amount of links each predicament has. This idea is less clear in my mind but could it be reasonable to make a topographic map where every predicament category is a mountain range and each mountain a predicament? The height of the mountain could then be directly related to how many links the predicament has. Perhaps?</p>
<img src="img/topographic.png" width="100%">
<p>In summary, I will revise how the actual map is to be made and then most likely illustrate and then publish all of it at once instead of in tedious, badly hand-drawn chunks.</p>
<p>There is also a growing desire to turn away from the predicaments, the burning building of modernity, and turn towards life, towards what to do, what to envision. Currently, I just call this...</p>
<h4>The Overlay</h4>
<p>250 counter-elements to each predicament, hopefully with even more cosmic implications. I have started to write some of these already and will start publishing material soon. It is still mostly in research mode, where I collect resources, quotes, thoughts, ideas, and practices. The overlay excites me but it also scares me. Why? I'm not sure. There is, perhaps, a certain distance between one's self and one's complaints, as if expressing what one dislikes is just a stone cast into space. What one truly believes is good, beautiful, true, or right points straight to one's soul, it is a deeply personal exposure and each stone cast forms a structure reflecting one's deepest desires and dreams. It's easy to believe that everyone is too dumb for their own good. It's not that easy to wish that everyone could become wiser. Is it because it risks disappointment? Or it forces one to be clear about one's priorities? With luck and perseverance, some of these questions might approach answers as I dive into the work with the overlay.</p>
<p>What then? 250 predicaments and 250 overlaid possibilities. What has been achieved? I'm not sure.</p>
<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>The more I work with creating this landscape, the more aware I become of its purpose. You mustn't worry that I am somehow blissfully unaware of the fact that few, if any, will read all of it, or even any of it. The purpose of this landscape, at its core, is, I believe, a public research project that will lead to something else, something more accessible and, dare I say, straight-forward. The Predicament Landscape is a 5CD collection of free improvisation jam sessions that will, or might, be condensed into an album short enough to fit on an LP. If you know how Talk Talk recorded their last two albums you might have good idea of what I mean. If you don't, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Eden#Recording">shame on you</a>. There is much uncertainty about how this will happen or what it will concretely be but since I am the way I am, I often prefer the improvisational jamming to the album. But that's me. I want to be of service to others and for all of this to have some sort of empowering effect on people, on you reading this. </p>

<h3>2024-12-04 Alive again</h3>
<p>December. After switching to a different antibiotic I am now finally getting better from the pneumonia that's been most of my existence for the past three weeks. It has resulted in me missing quite a lot. That's life. It has also made me rethink how to progress with the landscape but more on that soon... First, I need to keep resting and return to normal health.

<h3>2024-11-19 Promise of snow</h3>
<p>There is talk of snow. It's still a bit too warm for any snow to build up but I wholeheartedly welcome the falling flakes supposed to arrive later today. Meanwhile, Hilma sleeps under the blanket on the couch and I'm burning some incense on our balcony. The espresso I just brewed up turned out surprisingly well. I must really remember to add silicone grease to the piston seal on the espresso machine soon... It's getting too creaky.</p>
<p>Surprisingly little has been added to the landscape as of late. The predicaments in the Metacrisis of Evil have had all of their links remade and motivated and I'll spend some time today correcting some errors there. Illustrations for the Metacrisis of Evil are almost finished, just need to digitise them and somehow add them to the main svg. Not quite sure how to make sure it all displays properly but I'm sure I'll figure it out.</p>
<p>Some other news:

                <li>Started sharing this website with more people... It's scary but so far most feedback has been positive</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<h3>2024-10-22 Drizzle and treetops like flames</h3>
<p>Work is progressing slowly. The illustrating of the Metacrisis of Evil has met some resistance but should be finished either at the end of the current month or at the start of the next. I've made it so the website (sort of) functions on mobile devices and I've also done a quick correction and styling check on half of the predicaments. More work to come, as always.</p>
<p>Other than that, we are now well and truly in autumn. The autumnal palette has swept across the landscape and most migratory birds have passed us by. It darkens early and the sun rises timidly most days. All seasons have their beauty but autumn displays its somber grace proudly. Some music that has accompanied this autumnal phase of predicament work:</p>

<h3>2024-09-25 Rain & Evil</h3>
<p>The autumn equinox has been followed by days of darkness, pouring rain, and, consequently, calmness and coffee indoors. Many thoughts regarding balance and equilibrium have moved around in my mind lately. Anyways... I will be starting the process of illustrating and expanding the predicaments in the category currently named Metacrisis of Evil. The following predicaments are included in this category/continent:</p>
<ul>
