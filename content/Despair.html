<title>Despair</title>
<h2>Despair</h2>
<p>The world, your life, and the lives of others need you to refrain from despair. Despite this, momentary despair can be a sign of a healthy grief process for what has been and is being lost. If you can travel across this landscape without any feeling of despair, I'm unsure of what to tell you. How aware of your direct reality are you at this moment? <strong>To despair is to lose all hope</strong>. The predicament landscape is fortunately complex beyond hope. There is no hope, and there doesn't need to be any, just act and trust the direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have had to experience so much stupidity, so many vices, so much error, so much nausea, disillusionment and sorrow, just in order to become a child again and begin anew. I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the greatest mental depths, to thoughts of suicide, in order to experience grace.</p>
<br> - Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha</p>
