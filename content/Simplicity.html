<title>Simplicity</title>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Any intelligent fool can invent further complications, but it takes a genius to retain, or recapture, simplicity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Post-complexity simplicity</p>
<p>Waters as waters, mountains as mountains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity ... Limit everything to the essential but do not remove the poetry.</p>
<br>Dieter Rams</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the simplicity that lies this side of complexity, I would not give a fig, but for the simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity, I would give my life.</p>
<br>Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>
