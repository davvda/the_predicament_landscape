<title>Elderly care</title>
<h2>Elderly care</h2>
<p>Older people are useless, a burden on society. They have nothing to contribute with while they leech money, time, and work from us all. Well, yes, because we make them useless and, trust me, they would like nothing more than to contribute and be of use while living a life of leisure and rest after years of labour. Many cultures refer to older people as elders and the contribution of the elders was often caring for and passing on knowledge and wisdom to the younger people, and particularly the children, of the culture, deepening the cultural roots of the people, making sure the chain of wisdom stretching to the beginning of time never broke.</p>
<p><strong>Modernity leaves older people alone in their homes until death comes knocking</strong>, relatives perhaps visiting when they happen to be in the area, if they have relatives, or in old folk's homes tended to by underpaid nurses and apathetic youngsters.</p>

If we are so advanced, virtuous, wise, and clever... Why are our elderly sitting in their own shit waiting for their memories to fade while ringing the bell for an overworked and underpaid adolescent to come and aid them?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Unpaid important labour.html">Unpaid important labour</a></strong> - A slightly different take on this connection. The predicament of unpaid important labour largely talks about the fact that much important labour goes unpaid. Now, that isn't necessarily an issue. The issue is that we're so incentivised to exclusively focus on that which pays monetarily. What happens, then, is that all labour that isn't paid ends up being passed to someone who can get paid for it. So we end up in a world where a working person caring for their children or their aging parents is making a mistake in the system wherein they live. The correct choice, the incentivised option, is to offload all unpaid work to someone else. So, in short, the most important labour, most frequently the labour associated with love and care, is disincentivised and unpaid and offloaded to someone who can get the same work done but without the actual love and care. Highly efficient, benevolent hell.</li>
