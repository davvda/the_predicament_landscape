<title>Biased evidence selection</title>
<h2>Biased evidence selection</h2>
<p><strong>Biased evidence selection means selecting true facts that support only one side of an argument.</strong> A fact being true doesn't mean you have the whole truth about something. Many things in the world have gotten better the past hundred years and many things have gotten worse, only looking at one side will give you an untrue model of the world. Two opposing facts about something can both be true. In fact, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-36394-8_39">truths rarely come without contradictions</a>. Healthcare can both have gotten better and worse. Education can both have gotten better and worse. The Rosling-Pinker narrative tends to go hand in hand with the naive progress narrative claiming that everything is getting better and with time and technology we will end up living in a utopia.</p>
<p>To illustrate this we can look at Hans Rosling's famous example of washing machines. In short, he saw washing machines as a proxy for increased equality and socio-economic status. Women wouldn't need to spend all that time on tough manual labour every day to keep their families' clothes clean. Instead they could now... Well, what? Important to note is that I have no intention of glorifying either poverty or manual labour, rather, I want to point out the opposite side of a commonly one-sided evidence of progress. What the women freed from the labour of washing clothes now have more time for is, most often, working in the global economic system. This could be getting a job in a factory. What might end up happening is that women who had a routine of washing clothes with other women in the community, talking, gossiping, building relations, and being home and caring for their children now have less time in their local community, less time with their children, but more time working for someone else. If a factory gets built near a community, allowing the community to earn enough money to buy washing machines, the factory is seen as a humanitarian success, the backside being a lack of time and potentially a polluted river where once women were working and singing together. Or not. Do we believe we understand?</p>

the world is too full to talk about.</p>
