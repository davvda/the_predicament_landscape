<title>Global supply chains</title>
<h2>Global supply chains</h2>
<p>Look around at the objects around you and try to figure out how many parts of the world have been involved in the production of those objects. <strong>Global supply chains are spread out across the world and include the flow of information, processes, and resources.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fragile global supply chains are sensitive to disruptions</strong>. The COVID-19 pandemic showed clearly the lack of resilience of modern day global supply chains. As our civilisation tries to weather transition and collapse these low-probability high-impact events are likely to occur more often risking even larger disruptions to global supply chains.</p>
