<title>Agriculture</title>
<h2>Agriculture</h2>
<p><strong>Agriculture is the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/culture#etymonline<em>v</em>452">cultivation and caring for the fields of the Earth</a></strong>, generally with the purpose of providing us with food but also fuels, fibres, and other raw materials. It includes crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.</p>
<p>The introduction of agricultural practices during the Neolithic revolution more than 10,000 years ago started transitioning most of humanity from a life of hunting and gathering to a settled life of farming. It is not unreasonable to see this as the starting point of many of our predicaments. Even though that may be stating things too simplistically this change in our ways of life undeniably defines much of what life is for us in modern times. Importantly though, the magnitude of this change exploded during the last millennium. A thousand years ago around 4% of Earth's usable land was used for farming. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use">This number today falls somewhere around 50%</a>. With half of our planet being actively cultivated, our agricultural practices matter greatly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...where ever food is grown the growing of it will raise the same two questions: How do you preserve the land in use? And how do you preserve the people who use the land?</p>

Before the bulldozer quit work, water had already begun to seep in. Soon there was enough to support a few head of stock. To heal the exposed ground, I fertilized it and sowed it with grass and clover. ... The trouble was the familiar one: too much power, too little knowledge. The fault was mine. ... And yet there is damage - to my place, and to me. I have carried out, before my own eyes and against my intention, a part of the modern tragedy: I have made a lasting flaw in the face of the earth, for no lasting good. Until that wound in the hillside, my place, is healed, there will be something impaired in my mind. My peace is damaged. I will not be able to forget it."</a></li>
