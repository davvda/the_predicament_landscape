<h2>Algorithmic curation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithmic curation is the organising and presentation of online media using algorithms designed to personalise the content shown</strong>. Its purpose is mainly to increase the platform's revenue by keeping the user coming back and staying for longer. It takes the power of choice and agency from the user and instead puts it in the platform's hands, portraying this switch as something beneficial for the user. Algorithmic curation can be used for good but will mainly follow the incentives and top priorities of the owners of the platforms, these priorities are seldom the well-being of its users.</p>
<p>Algorithmic curation, in its present form and with its current surroundings, leaves us scrolling, paying, unhappy, horny, angry, and unknowingly obedient. Eat the rich.</p>

<p>Settle down, Mark, you're moving fast enough.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of understanding.html">Illusion of understanding</a></strong> - You might be thinking that the services you use that have algorithmic curation are simply useful. Maybe you're recommended music that you like or the commercials you see feel more relevant to your life. Can you truly claim to understand what is going on long-term, the incentives of the services, the potential sculpting of your tastes, preferences, identity, attention, and thoughts? I'm not writing this from a place of superiority where I claim to understand it. I don't understand what this constant nudging could do to me so I try my best to avoid it because I am at least convinced that the incentives of most companies presenting algorithmically curated feeds are opposite to my own. My advice to you is that service that has clear utility while having questionable incentives should be avoided. Don't trust your lower self to be deaf to their whispers.</li>
