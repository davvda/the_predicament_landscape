<title>Lack of compassion</title>
<h2>Lack of compassion</h2>
<p><strong>Compassion means to suffer with someone and feel together</strong>. A lack of compassion typically results in and from the closing of eyes and ears, halting the perception of the suffering of others, being blind and deaf to the afflictions one often has contributed in creating, willingly or not. Without compassion we end up with, well, much of the world as it is today. Killing with compassion is possible, industrial slaughter is not. Compassion is, more importantly, recognising and feeling someone else's feelings <em>and</em> taking an active role in somehow helping the afflicted.</p>

	<li><a href="Animal views.html">Animal views</a> - I was posed the question by my wife recently why I of all people decided to have a child in a time where the birth rate has been decreasing due to worries about the future, the economy, etc. Shouldn't I, someone who has almost made "the coming collapse" my hobby, be the one least likely to put new life on the earth? It's an interesting question but not difficult to answer. I believe I have already given up what people fear is being taken away from them and I also fear the current state of the world more than many others. Things are dark now, though they can seem bright to those who won't look. My daughter being born into a world where the present state of things will and must continue is a much darker thought than believing she's been born at a time of change and, if you will, "collapse". And no, I am not so naive as to not include aspects like increasing risks of violent conflicts, societal turmoil, lack of food, water, electricity, just overall chaos and loss, yet I believe the frequently hidden aspects of our smoothly running systems are much, much worse than whatever's approaching. The lack of compassion most people show for the short lives of the majority of animals serving humanity is something that utterly baffles me and, with some luck, we're at peak levels approaching decline.</li>
