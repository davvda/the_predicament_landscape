<h2>Investing</h2>
<p>An investment is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment">the commitment of resources to achieve later benefits</a></strong>. There are many types of investments such as stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, loans, cryptocurrencies, and more. Investments must include the notion of ownership and for an investment to be successful it usually means that either you won and someone else lost (zero-sum) or whatever area you invested in grew financially. Another important point is that any investment into something is an action that tries to shape the world, meaning that whatever is invested in will be pushed to succeed while whatever isn't invested in will be ignored. <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/invest"><strong>Dressing parts of the future in your own colours</strong></a> makes you wonder what future generations will think of the ruins covered in our tattered robes.</p>
