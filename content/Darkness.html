<h2>Darkness</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In those days (and maybe the present as well) it was friendship, or perhaps I should say alliance with artists, poets, photographers etc. that shaped me much more so than musicians. They would gather at the modern jazz clubs. If I was influenced by anyone, it would have to have been through conversation, socialization and interaction with those people. That was always a source of motivation. And it continues to be so. In regards to music... I've always been listening to jazz. Coltrane, Ayler, Davis and Coleman, the usual suspects. But their braind of jazz is anything but 'usual'. There was likely some inspiration taken from them...<br>
Les Rallizes Dénudés, however, is rock n' roll. In our vein of rock, there was no guidebook. Just a set of four people (wielding instruments, of course). Our band's direction was decided the instant my electric guitar fed back. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that it wasn't just the guitar that I played. Night, freedom - the allure of the night. Since I am fond of the night, we naturally gravitated towards that. However, I can't succinctly explain this reasoning. I'll admit, it's just something about me. It's as if I'm <em>preserving the respect and honor of the night</em>.</p>
