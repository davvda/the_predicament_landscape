<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Peace of Wild Things</strong><br>
When despair for the world grows in me<br>
and I wake in the night at the least sound<br>
in fear of what my life and my children’s lives might be,<br>
I go and lie down where the wood drake<br>
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.<br>
I come into the peace of wild things<br>
who do not tax their lives with forethought<br>
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.<br>
And I feel above me the day-blind stars</p>
<br>I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.</p>
