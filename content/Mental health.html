<p>We, as humans, have not evolved for the ways of living modernity offers. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health">Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing cognition, perception, and behaviour</a>.</strong> Mental illness is therefore any long-term negatively affecting emotional or psychological condition which affects cognition, perception, behaviour, and overall well-being. Many mental illnesses are direct adaptations to the life of modernity, ways of managing the dissonance of a life with several needs and wants forever unmet, where some management methods end up being coincidentally beneficial and some crippling. I would even go so far as to say that those who are perfectly mentally healthy in the modern world are more worrying than those who aren't and I would, consequently, quite confidently, say that the cognition, perception, and behaviour required to be truly happy while balls-deep in modernity is the real illness.</p>
