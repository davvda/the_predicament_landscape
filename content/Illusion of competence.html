<title>Illusion of competence</title>
<h2>Illusion of competence</h2>
<p>While having coffee with a friend of mine, a PhD in economic history, he told me about a way one of his professors had explained the complexity of economics and causality. The professor asked my friend to imagine a room filled with crisscrossing ropes and trusses, creating a massive spider web of ropes in all directions. When you pulled one rope several other ropes would move in unexpected strange ways and if told to move a select few ropes in a certain way something always seemed to ruin it. Modern civilisation has remained seated in a small room with closed windows and doors, feeling competent in what to pull, completely ignorant of the fact that all ropes reach out through cracks in the walls, floor, and ceiling. Yet we sit there pulling and pulling and everything, well, everything seems great.</p>
<p>To be competent is to have the ability to do something well or efficiently. We, <strong>the people of modern civilisation, are extremely competent at believing we're competent when we're not</strong>. We are the least competent and the most helpless version of humans the earth has seen.</p>
