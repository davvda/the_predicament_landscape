<blockquote>
<p>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, that we suddenly were able to manage all of the predicaments in the landscape, that we somehow solved all of our problems and helped the Earth recover. The time preceding this moment will, I believe, be seen as one of the most catastrophic collapses of life the Earth has ever seen. In just a few hundred years the Earth has gone from a beautiful, wild, and diverse place to a planet where more than 95% of mammals are cattle bred for food, pets bred for obedience, and humans pushed to compliance. The Earth is, of course, still beautiful and diverse, and has some wildness left. My argument is simply that so much has already collapsed and is already collapsing, <strong>the collapse is not some future event</strong>. The same goes for the economy, the climate, ecosystems, social welfare, spirituality, and life force in general. It is already happening, how do we control the descent, save what can be saved, and work on recovering and cultivating, fermenting, something better in and from the ruins?</p>
<p><strong>The collapse is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.</strong></p>
