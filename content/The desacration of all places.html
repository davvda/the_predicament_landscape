<title>The desacration of all places</title>
<h2>The desacration of all places</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Breathe with unconditional breath<br>
the unconditioned air.<br>
Shun electric wire.<br>
Communicate slowly. Live<br>
a three-dimensioned life;<br>
stay away from screens.<br>
Stay away from anything<br>
that obscures the place it is in.<br>
There are no unsacred places;<br>
there are only sacred places<br>
and desecrated places.</p>
<br>Wendell Berry</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>There is no place left on Earth that hasn't in some way been affected by modern civilisation</strong>. If we manage to thread the needle and enter a future of second chances we must initiate a resacration of the Earth.</p>
<p>The devastation that might follow from delving too deeply into the Earth or not paying ones respects to the spirits of the forests will open the gates to hell and, when opened, there are no sacred places left for the remaining spirits that have the power to overcome the demons spawned from our own depths.</p>
