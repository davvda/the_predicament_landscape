<p>The Exchange from Always Coming Home?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Salvage</strong> the good things we have a chance of taking with us; <strong>mourn</strong> the good things we're not able to take with us, and tell their stories; <strong>notice</strong> the things that were never as good as we told each other they were, and the chance we're being given to leave these behind; and <strong>pick up the dropped threads</strong> from earlier in the story, the practices that were marked as "old-fashioned", "inefficient" or "obsolete", but which may yet make all the difference.</p>
