<title>Climate footprints</title>
<h2>Climate footprints</h2>
<p>Did you know that Adolf Hitler was one of the main promoters and investors in a Silicon Valley scale-up aiming to allow individuals to be held accountable for the amount of Jews they indirectly exterminated? No? Did you know that the personal carbon footprint was first promoted by British Petroleum? Well, <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham">there you go</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Climate footprint, or carbon footprint, is a calculated value or index that enables the comparison of climate-related impacts of different activities</strong>. The climate-related impact measured is almost exclusively global warming potential indexed with the unit CO2e, carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>A bit of inside information. I've worked with many carbon accounting people and they all have one thing in common. They spew more bullshit than they can carbon-offset.</p>
