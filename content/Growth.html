<title>Growth</title>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>To grow is to increase, develop, get bigger, and, ideally, flourish. Growth in the predicament landscape mainly, but not only, entails economic growth whose snooze-worthy definition is <strong>the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the services and goods produced by an economy</strong> over a certain amount of time, usually a year. When related to measurable material welfare growth might be the best thing that ever happened to humanity and if unchanged and extrapolated into the future it might very well be the worst. Growth cannot continue indefinitely and many of our current predicaments come from the fact that there are limits to our growth.</p>
