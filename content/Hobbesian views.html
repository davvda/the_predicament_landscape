<title>Hobbesian views</title>
<h2>Hobbesian views</h2>
<p>Humans are at their core mechanistic. Left to their own devices they would live in a war of all against all, completely lacking industry, culture, knowledge, art, literature, society, and instead live in a constant state of fear and danger of violent death. <strong>A solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short life</strong>. According to Thomas Hobbes that is. Humans need to be controlled through a social contract and a civil society with one sovereign authority in control of everything in order to protect them, he continues.</p>
<p>There are surely some truths to be found in Hobbes' theories of moral and political philosophy, especially with regards to a machine constructed by human beings that somehow controls them more than they control it. Nevertheless, Hobbesian views will most likely lead to the creation of the very mechanistic creatures it wants to control. <em>How we see determines what we see</em>.</p>
