<blockquote>
<p>For many generations�they obeyed the laws and loved the divine to which they were akin�they reckoned that qualities of character were far more important than their present prosperity. So they bore the burden of their wealth and possessions lightly, and did not let their high standard of living intoxicate them or make them lose their self-control�</p>
<br>But when the divine element in them became weakened�and their human traits became predominant, they ceased to be able to carry their prosperity with moderation.</p>
<br>Plato, Timaeus (the story of Atlantis)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status">Social status is the relative level of social value a person is considered to possess</a></strong>. It seemingly gets more important the higher it is, meaning that the more status one has, the more time and energy will be spent keeping or increasing it. Status is mostly correlated with wealth, either direct financial wealth or indirect contextual wealth through one's contacts, friends, family, royalty, race, appearance, name, title, etc. According to Weber, status is one of three aspects of societal stratification, the other two being class and power.</p>
