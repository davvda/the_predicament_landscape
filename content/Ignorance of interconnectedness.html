<title>Ignorance of interconnectedness</title>
<h2>Ignorance of interconnectedness</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.</p>
<br>Bill Hicks</p>

<p>Many seem to be completely ignorant of the interconnectedness of the world. I suppose this isn't unexpected when we are taught and conditioned by a system that holds each individual as just that, individual.</p>
<p>When we cut off our roots to the Earth we can finally run free. Free from what? Where will we go? <strong>A rootless tree will be felled by the weakest gust of wind</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="Agriculture.html">Agriculture</a></strong> - All problems of agriculture are solved almost in a vacuum, in a closed-off system. A closed-off system that unfortunately isn't closed-off, the effects of these solutions becoming apparent in all surrounding systems. Go read Wendell Berry.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Animal views.html">Animal views</a></strong> - We try our very best to sever our ties to the animal kingdom.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Apathy.html">Apathy</a></strong> - Of course, if you see no connection between you and others, caring doesn't come easy.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Cognitive dissonance.html">Cognitive dissonance</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - Most examples of complexity mismatches in human-created systems stem from an overly simplified cartesian view that doesn't, and can't, include the fact that the subsystem in question is connecting to everything else in the universe. Or at the very least a nearby forest or the sexual development in adolescents.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Constant connectivity.html">Constant connectivity</a></strong> - Longing to explicitly feel that connection which is always there?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Delusional domination of nature.html">Delusional domination of nature</a></strong> - I'm fairly tall and whenever I hit my toe it takes a while for the pain to register. Since about the 1800s I've stubbed my toe all day every day. That fucking toe literally bends according to my will. Wait, what is that I'm feeling? Shit, you feel it too?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Emotional crisis.html">Emotional crisis</a></strong> - Supported by nothing we tearlessly cry.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Failure to take responsibility.html">Failure to take responsibility</a></strong> - What am I suggesting then? Everyone should take responsibility for everything? Sort of, something along those lines, yes. I'd even argue it's a feasible demand.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Faulty meta-optimisation.html">Faulty meta-optimisation</a></strong> - We optimise too narrowly.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignorance of ongoing collapse.html">Ignorance of ongoing collapse</a></strong> - Dominoes tippin' over everywhere.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignored externalities.html">Ignored externalities</a></strong> - Externalities can be more or less obvious but if you're wholly ignorant of how everything is interconnected then you're just well and truly fucked.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignoring complexity.html">Ignoring complexity</a></strong> - The complexity of life and the world lies in its interconnected, interweaving nature. Have I mentioned that recursion is my favourite abstract concept? When I first heard of recursive abstraction, damn, you could hang a woolen Ulster coat on that erection.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignoring diversity.html">Ignoring diversity</a></strong> - Interconnectedness can lead to things being much more diverse than you might expect.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of competence.html">Illusion of competence</a></strong> - What you don't know about won't hurt you, at least not directly and immediately. Living in an easily optimisable made-up mental world with clear boundaries, it is easy to fool yourself into believing you know what you're doing.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of understanding.html">Illusion of understanding</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Individualism.html">Individualism</a></strong> - If you're a node without a web, all that matters is you, the li'l node.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of belonging.html">Lack of belonging</a></strong> - You are who you are largely because of your place in connection and relation to others. And this includes everything, not just people. Y'know, I gave my daughter's navel string to the creek where I live.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of love.html">Lack of love</a></strong> - There is a quote from a book. I actually hate the book but somehow this quote must've hit me at the right time in life. "Love isn't a noun, it's a verb". What book? 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. God. Anyway, love as a verb needs a connection to traverse. Acts of love and the giving of love does not travel well across an empty vacuum.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of resilient systems.html">Lack of resilient systems</a></strong> - Resilient systems are deeply interwoven systems.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of systems thinking.html">Lack of systems thinking</a></strong> - Systems thinking is almost definitionally considering the interconnectedness of things.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Meaning crisis.html">Meaning crisis</a></strong> - If everything is connected, no matter how frail that connection is, it makes it so that everything you do actually matters, it has some meaning in the web of it all.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Mind-body separation.html">Mind-body separation</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Naive progress narrative.html">Naive progress narrative</a></strong> - Bounded, narrow progress is not progress.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="No precautionary principle.html">No precautionary principle</a></strong> - Willful ignorance of interconnectedness.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Poisoning the water, the earth, the air.html">Poisoning the water, the earth, the air</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Pollution.html">Pollution</a></strong> - Many companies seem to act a bit like unfaithful husbands going to Germany to fuck prostitutes. Surely, whatever happens stays where it happened?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Selfishness.html">Selfishness</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Sense-making crisis.html">Sense-making crisis</a></strong> - Seeing things as interconnected is the major point this landscape is trying to push in order to battle our sense-making crisis.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Simplifications.html">Simplifications</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Solutionism.html">Solutionism</a></strong> - Solutions in isolation are too narrow.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Spiritual metacrisis.html">Spiritual metacrisis</a></strong> - I mean, the interconnectedness of everything has sort of been the main gist of most spiritual traditions. Just imagine the Buddha's reaction to us calling whatever happened in Europe a few hundred years ago "the enlightenment". Actually, he'd most likely take it quite serenely, like he's watching toddlers urinate in a sandbox...</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Story of separation.html">Story of separation</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Tipping points.html">Tipping points</a></strong> - One small domino might suddenly tip over a massive one. If you never stop to consider it, you won't see it until it's crashing down on you.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Waste.html">Waste</a></strong> - What goes around comes around. May you one day wake up in a sea of cigarette butts and eggshells.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Wisdom crisis.html">Wisdom crisis</a></strong> - Not seeing that all borders are fuzzy, all atomistic elements illusory, every thing no singular <em>thing</em> at all. That's one of the very first steps in the trek of wisdom we're hesitant to head out on.</li>
