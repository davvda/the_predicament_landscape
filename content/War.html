<title>War</title>
<h2>War</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>we drifted through it, arguing.<br>
every day a new war crime, every day a flower bloom.<br>
we sat down together and wrote it in one room,<br>
and then sat down in a different room, recording.<br>
NO TITLE= what gestures make sense while tiny bodies fall? what context? what broken melody?<br>
and then a tally and a date to mark a point on the line, the negative process, the growing pile.<br>
the sun setting above beds of ash<br>
while we sat together, arguing.<br>
the old world order barely pretended to care.<br>
this new century will be crueler still.<br>
war is coming.<br>
don't give up.<br>
pick a side.<br>
hang on.<br>
love.</p>
<br> - Godspeed You! Black Emperor, No Title as of 13 February 2024 28,340 Dead</p>

<p><strong>A war is a violent conflict between two or more entities</strong>. Wars can have many purposes but the most common is for the victorious to become more powerful and the defeated to either become powerless or to be vanquished completely. Most modern warfare consists of proxy-wars between the most powerful on a global stage of assumed unimportant destruction, nowadays this lethal drama is set in the Middle East. However, as time goes on and the unfulfilled promises of modernity break the surface there will be increased tensions between all entities of power.</p>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a></strong> - War tends to accelerate several processes. There are perhaps two main reasons. One, close to entire populations and work forces suddenly focus on one thing only. The development and manufacturing of certain technologies benefit greatly from this monofocus. Many technological innovations have come from the need and desire to win wars. Secondly, war completely destroys any argument in favour of precautionary principles. Full steam ahead, you magnificent beast.</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Architecture.html">Architecture</a></strong> - What do you know about why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old<em>Town,</em>Warsaw">old town of Warsaw</a> is special? War shapes, changes, destroys, creates architecture.</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Colonialist narratives.html">Colonialist narratives</a></strong> - The colonialist powers fighting most wars can then, through their victories, further add to their own narratives that speak of their heroic acts that keep the world in order.</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Disinformation.html">Disinformation</a></strong> - The only way to motivate warfare is through disinformation. How else will we justify the slaughtering of people like us?</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth).html">Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)</a></strong> - The invasion by Russia of Ukraine surprised many people. Suddenly white people were being affected by war. How terrible.</li>

Oh, never mind. War seems to confirm our views of human nature, the same views used to justify starting wars in the first place. Civilise the savages. Savage the civilised.</li>
	<li>  <strong><a href="Identity.html">Identity</a></strong> - A country's identity is often cemented through its warfare against a common enemy. What are you, a god damned communist?</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Industrial slaughter.html">Industrial slaughter</a></strong> - What is war but industrial slaughter? What is industrial slaughter but a one-sided war? Imagine if Hitler bred jews for the gas chambers.</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Mistreatment of other humans.html">Mistreatment of other humans</a></strong> - Torture, rape, murder, and killing is pretty clearly mistreatment. War is basically purposeful industrialised mistreatment of humans.</li>
	<li>  <strong><a href="Modern slavery.html">Modern slavery</a></strong> - Soldiers are slaves for higher powers. They might not feel like it. That's the point. An African-American picking cotton for his owner, chasing a future of imagined heroism and tales of glory, now that's successful conditioning.

Rather, I'm impressed by their ability to justify their own existence when they brush their teeth in the morning.</li>
	<li>  <strong><a href="No precautionary principle.html">No precautionary principle</a></strong> - When developing technologies with the purpose of winning wars, caution goes out the window faster than you can say Quidditch.</li>
	<li>  <strong><a href="Nuclear war.html">Nuclear war</a></strong> - Every war risks turning into a nuclear war. Most people would be horrified if they knew how close we've been to the apocalypse on several occasions.

	<li>  <strong><a href="Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a></strong> - Propaganda is a necessity in preparation for, during, and after war. In other words, propaganda is always necessary.</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="The spectacle.html">The spectacle</a></strong> - The killing of others has, for most of us, for now, largely become a spectacle to follow, watch, discuss, and be entertained by.</li>
