<title>Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)</title>
<h2>Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)</h2>
<p>There are numerous ways in which a large part of the world gets ignored or forgotten. Who has access to the internet, who is included in scientific studies, who is affected by climate change, who is seen as more or less human, who has the right to have opinions, who is seen as developed, intelligent, responsible, honest, beautiful, wise, whose existence is justified, who has a right to live, who has a right to love. What map projections we use, what poverty means, what places are important, what places need fixing, what places are colonised, what places are deemed to need industrialisation. We can make sweeping statements about the global south, the third world, western and eastern world, developing countries, yet <strong>most of the "modern" world is ridiculously one-sided in its world view</strong>.</p>
