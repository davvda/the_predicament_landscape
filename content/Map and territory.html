<title>Map and territory</title>
<h2>Map and territory</h2>
<p><strong>The map is not the territory</strong>. No model or perception of reality can represent the entirety of actual reality. Importantly, the maps you use affect your view of reality. Coast lines are infinite, fractal, endless. Maps must choose a scale. Maps are abstractions of reality such as explanations, descriptions, theories, models, etc. Maps are useful and necessary to make sense of life and the world. However, using these maps require two vital points of understanding. Firstly, we must understand what the maps claim to capture. What is their focus, what has been ignored, what are the limits, which scale is chosen and why, what do the maps try to make sense of, etc. The models describing atoms and molecules can give insight into the properties of physical matter but it won't tell you how to get from Paris to Tokyo, or how to play the drums. There are other maps for that. Secondly, a map can never and will never capture all of reality. It will always be an abstraction, an approximation. If you use maps, models, theories, etc with these two points in mind, you'll stay out of most map-related trouble. Stray from these two, however, and you'll be so lost that you've left the territory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's another thing we've learned from your Nation," said Mein Herr, "map-making. But we've carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?"</p>
<br><em>"About six inches to the mile."</em></p>
<br>"Only six inches!" exclaimed Mein Herr. "We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!"</p>
<br><em>"Have you used it much?" I enquired.</em></p>
<br>"It has never been spread out, yet," said Mein Herr: "the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well."</p>
