<h2>Traffic noise</h2>
<p>We can close our eyes or avert our gaze but our ears stay constantly receptive and open. <strong>Traffic noise is, simply, any sound created by traffic</strong>. Roadway noise created primarily by tires <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/traffic">rubbing across</a> the roadway surface is the most prevalent form of environmental noise and there are few places in the modern world where this noise hasn't spread. Engines, transmissions, air resistance, braking, and any friction also contribute to traffic noise as well as horns and sirens.</p>
