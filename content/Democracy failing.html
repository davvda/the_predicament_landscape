<title>Democracy failing</title>
<h2>Democracy failing</h2>
<p><strong>Democracy is a system of government whereby the state is ruled by the people</strong>. This is most often achieved by having the rulers elected through voting by the people. Many governments today are, or claim to be, democratically elected governments. There are countless arguments as to why this might not necessarily be the case, and since democracy seems to be the least bad form of government system we have it is vital to not let democracy fail as, I believe, we currently are. The most obvious failings of democracy are technology, especially as it relates to media and information, and economy, specifically wealth disparities and overall expressions of modern capitalism. A simplified view perhaps, but a decent one nonetheless. Technology allows manipulation of the opinions of the masses while capitalism justifies wealth accumulation, and consequently, power disparities. This is not democracy.</p>
