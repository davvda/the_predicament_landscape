<title>Evil</title>
<h2>Evil</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.</p>
<br>Gautama Buddha</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Evil is the exponential externalisation of internal suffering</strong>. It is an unleashing of inner demons into the world, their power multiplied by hatred, revenge, destruction, death, pain, apathy, and war. Every person must overcome their own evils.</p>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Industrial slaughter.html">Industrial slaughter</a></strong> - The industry of slaughter is, I think, without a doubt, going to be regarded as the most evil act ever done on Earth in all its history by any being.

	<li>  <strong><a href="Lack of cultural control systems.html">Lack of cultural control systems</a></strong> - Many cultures have had clear control systems for managing and hindering acts of evil and instead cultivating balance and harmony.

	<li>  <strong><a href="Lack of faith in anything.html">Lack of faith in anything</a></strong> - Humans can be many things. Evil is one of them. When humans seem inherently to harbour so many demons, what hope and faith can there be?</li>

	<li>  <strong><a href="Nihilism.html">Nihilism</a></strong> - Evil needs nihilism. To nihilists, there is no such thing as evil so why should it matter what evil one spreads?</li>
	<li>  <strong><a href="Nuclear war.html">Nuclear war</a></strong> - One of the most extreme exponential acts of evil is the detonation of atom bombs.</li>
