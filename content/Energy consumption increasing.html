<title>Energy consumption increasing</title>
<h2>Energy consumption increasing</h2>
<p>The last 100 years have seen an increase in global yearly energy consumption from around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption">10,000 TWh to 180,000 TWh</a>, <strong>an increase of 1800%</strong>. Oil, coal, and natural gas make up around 75% of current energy consumption. The daily energy consumption per person has for the past 500 years increased from around 5kWh to 58kWh.</p>
