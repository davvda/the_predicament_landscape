<title>Exponential technology</title>
<h2>Exponential technology</h2>
<p><strong>Exponential technologies are technologies that in one way or another follow an exponential path</strong>. This behaviour can be due to a technology that spreads exponentially across domains, grows exponentially in use, exhibits exponential intrinsic behaviour, requires exponential energy, or sees exponential progress in its own development. The number of real and potentially exponential technologies has increased with the invention of the computer. Whereas the expanding use of the steam engine required physical parts and specific knowledge, information through software travels at the speed of light. Humans lack intuition for exponential behaviours and care must be taken for us to not invent and develop our own doom. <em>How to wisely handle exponential technologies is possibly one of our most difficult predicaments</em>.</p>
