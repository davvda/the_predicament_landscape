<h2>Insect loss</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Why should we tolerate a diet of weak poisons, a home in insipid surroundings, a circle of acquaintances who are not quite our enemies, the noise of motors with just enough relief to prevent insanity? Who would want to live in a world which is just not quite fatal?</p>
<br>Rachel Carson, Silent Spring</p>

<p>Insects make up 90% of all animal species on Earth and are crucial parts of all ecosystems with pollinators being particularly important for the food supply for other animals and humans. Insect decline is a complex area to study and estimates on the rate of decline vary in different localities. A 2020 meta-analysis estimated a decline rate of 9% per decade for terrestrial insects but, notably, an increase in freshwater insects of 11% per decade. Most research, however, show declines in insects globally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A March 2019 statement by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America">Entomological Society of America</a> said <em>there was not yet sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects</em> and that some of the extrapolated predictions might "have been extended well past the limits of the data or have been otherwise over-hyped"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what to make of the quote above. Data can always be misleading but if we are actually <strong>risking a mass extinction of insects</strong> I don't see how taking that seriously is over-hyping. If what we need before we decide to change current trends is "sufficient data" to be collected then we really are fucked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts.</p>
