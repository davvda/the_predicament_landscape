<title>Genetic modification</title>
<h2>Genetic modification</h2>
<p><strong>Genetic modification means modifying the underlying genetic blueprint for any organism</strong> using technology, usually with the intent of adding desirable traits and/or removing undesirable ones, but also creating novel organisms. It is potentially the final stepping stone in our manipulation-focused mechanistic view of life.</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a></strong> - Genetic modification is one path to accelerating evolution as well as potentially accelerating us towards catastrophe.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Access to food.html">Access to food</a></strong> - It might increase crop yields but the total effect of genetic modification on our access to food and proper nutrition is as of yet inconclusive.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Access to water.html">Access to water</a></strong> - Several genetically modified crops require increased pesticide use, much of which ends up polluting water sources.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - Genetically modified crops can often mean an increase in yield and a narrowing of ideal conditions.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Delusional domination of nature.html">Delusional domination of nature</a></strong> - Even I'll concede that our advancements in genetics is the least delusional domination of nature we've come up with. Though, we should be clear that what we see in the mirror is a demon, not a god.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Ignorance of the mythical.html">Ignorance of the mythical</a></strong> - If you picture the person, scientist, wizard, whatever, that is meddling with the "blueprint of life" in any mythical story, is this person portrayed as a villain or a hero?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of competence.html">Illusion of competence</a></strong> - I, for one, do not in the slightest trust our abilities to ensure that genetic modifications can be done safely. I also don't trust in our initial benevolence ensuring that we even try to do it safely. In general, if it isn't already clear from the entire landscape, I would not trust humanity with more power than can be achieved through hand tools unless we first find the wisdom to usefully wield such power.</li>

GMO does seem to increase the amount of monocultures but the larger effects of this change is as of yet difficult to conclude.</li>

Genetic modification with more or less artificial means have always been part of our agricultural practices and will continue to play an important role in the future. This technology has arrived and is here to stay, no matter its shape, and we'd do well to learn how to wield it wisely.</li>
