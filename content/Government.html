<h2>Government</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If voting made any difference they wouldn't let us do it.</p>
<br>Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A government is a system and/or group ruling a community</strong>. The purpose of government is to steer and direct the community it serves/rules. There exist several types of governmental systems, each of which presents its own predicaments and problems. Governments rule mainly through creating and enforcing laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments want efficient technicians, not human beings, because human beings become dangerous to governments and to organized religions as well. That is why governments and religious organizations seek to control education.</p>
<br>J. Krishnamurti</p>
