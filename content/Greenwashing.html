<title>Greenwashing</title>
<h2>Greenwashing</h2>
<p><strong>Greenwashing is a form of advertising where organisations try to persuade the public that they are more environmentally friendly than they are</strong>. I have seen few examples of organisations claiming to be environmentally friendly who aren't simply greenwashing. I also believe greenwashing goes further than advertising. For example, carbon accounting might appear honest and organisations who choose to be public about their emissions sometimes mean well. However, these numbers mostly serve to greenwash their operations on a deeper level unless those emission numbers aren't all-encompassing and accurate as well as concretely acted upon. Greenwashing also furthers the issue of people destroying the world with a good conscience, . If you incessantly insist that you're a good person there's a high chance that you're not.</p>
