<h2>Lack of feeling needed</h2>
<p>You are needed. At the very least, if you disagree, you are needed in the sense that you are a part of the world and with the changing of the world there will be a change of you. What you do with and about this change is up to you. Modernity has, however, created the predicament that <strong>few, if any, feel needed</strong>. Maybe there is, at the very ground of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the need to feel needed.</p>
