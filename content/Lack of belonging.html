<title>Lack of belonging</title>
<h2>Lack of belonging</h2>
<p><strong>Do you belong somewhere?</strong> Do the birds miss you when they leave before the leaves change? Do the fields wonder where your footprints strayed when you're away? Is the moonlight in search of your shadow when you're gone? Does the sun rise hesitatingly, wonder whether to start the day before you've arrived?</p>
<p>Few of us modern humans can imagine the feeling of belonging that has dominated most of our species' history, I sure can't. Sometimes I feel a hint of it, like a drop of brackish water on the tip of my tongue, promising an ocean of eternal belonging somewhere beyond the archipelago.</p>
<p>We, as humans, require our people, our place, and a clarity of our role in it all. Most importantly, away from all abstraction, we require a feeling of belonging.</p>

	<li><a href="Loss of cultural complexity.html">Loss of cultural complexity</a> - Turns out that a globalised culture consisting of so-called individuals, all of them allowed to be "themselves" in all of their glory, becomes quite non-complex. Of course, I can't know that there are alternatives that are sure to be more complex but I can easily imagine that a world consisting of a mosaic of cultures, all interconnected but clearly themselves, each belonging to a place, the people in that place belonging to that culture... I don't know, there's something enticing here, isn't there? Idealistic? Unrealistic? Perhaps. Then again, what we have is unrealistic and terrible so I think we're allowed to envision something different.</li>

	<li><a href="No value in maintenance.html">No value in maintenance</a> - Not belonging anywhere, either in space nor time, there is no value in anything staying the way it is. One step further in this thought, not belonging anywhere, is there any value in anything? If we are who we are only in relation to other beings, who do we think we are?</li>

	<li><a href="Parenting.html">Parenting</a> - It takes a village to raise a child. Expand on that as far as you can. What is meant by the phrase? Diversity of people? More than just parents? Small enough to know everyone and therefore to know who you are and where you fit in? Different ages, professions, opinions? A support network? Local healthcare? Walking distance rather than highways? Keep going. We can make an entire landscape of 250 aspects of what it means that it takes a village to raise a child that knows it belongs.</li>
