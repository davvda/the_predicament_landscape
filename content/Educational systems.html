<title>Educational systems</title>
<h2>Educational systems</h2>
<p><strong>Many educational systems are more about indoctrination and training than cultivating understanding</strong>. Education should create dependable, predictable, and productive humans for the global systems of commerce and civilisational expansion. In a world where, for our continued survival, we must question everything we thought we knew, the educational system will always be several steps behind, discouraging any curiosity to leave the boundaries of the curriculum. The mental tools that can make sure that the world of your grandchildren isn't destroyed or dystopian is nowhere in the curriculum, sorry 'bout that.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Failure to take responsibility.html">Failure to take responsibility</a></strong> - The educational systems fail to take responsibility for what it creates or fails to create, and what it creates is more people unable to take responsibility for their own existence.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain).html">Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)</a></strong> - Atrophying the right hemisphere, doping the left.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth).html">Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignored externalities.html">Ignored externalities</a></strong> - The ignored externalities of education... Well, the failings of educating humans and making children into responsible adults who then continue the process of maturing is apparent in everything around us.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of competence.html">Illusion of competence</a></strong> - When I, after much toil, got my engineering degree I realised that I finally knew nothing about anything and I'd be paid well for it.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Imprisonment.html">Imprisonment</a></strong> - Is it taking it too far to claim that school is a temporary prison for children?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Missing elders.html">Missing elders</a></strong> - What type of person decides to become a teacher? Often a well-meaning person, I'm sure. In Buddhism you sometimes say that none should ever teach unless asked to teach. Will those whose teachings are most valuable become school teachers? Maybe you sneer, thinking that the routine kneading of children's minds, the decade or more of formal schooling that serves as the singular passage through childhood and adolescence, the shaping of the world-view of all citizens, it's nothing but a job, and everyone needs a job.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Quantification.html">Quantification</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Rationalism.html">Rationalism</a></strong> - Unsure about this. I don't remember my schooling touching on the subject of being rational but still, there is a weak connection here somewhere.</li>
