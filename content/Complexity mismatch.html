<title>Complexity mismatch</title>
<h2>Complexity mismatch</h2>
<p>For a system to be resilient it is required to have <strong>complex responses to complex threats</strong>. When the behaviour of the threat is more complex than the response of the system it is unlikely that the system will respond in a way that ensures its continued existence. This is a complexity mismatch.</p>
<p>A simple illustrating example of a complexity mismatch with regards to ecosystems could be comparing an old growth forest to a planted forest. An old growth forest consisting of an intricate web of thousands or millions of organisms all contributing to the maintenance of their dwelling place makes it resilient to change, its complexity creating a nearly infinite amount of responses to any major destabilising event. In contrast to this a planted forest consisting of a single type of tree will most likely not have the time or the conditions to develop much complexity leading to the risk that even a minor destabilising event causes a complete collapse.</p>
