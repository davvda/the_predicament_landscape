<title>Immoral justifications</title>
<h2>Immoral justifications</h2>
<p>Justification is the act of showing something to be right or proper. Morals are principles concerning right and proper behaviour of humans in society. The paradox of modernity with its notions of progress largely stems from our uncanny ability to justify our improper actions, both to others but maybe more so to ourselves. <strong>Our justifications of moral are quite immoral</strong>. We need this immoral veneer of justifications to separate and protect us from the higher order effects of our needs and consequent actions, in order to believe that we are good people when, in reality, we might, mostly unwillingly and unknowingly, be eons away from the civilised saintliness we imagine.</p>
