<title>Finite games</title>
<h2>Finite games</h2>
<p>There are, according to James Carse, two kinds of games. <strong>Finite games are played for the purpose of winning</strong> and infinite games for the purpose of continuing the play. An infinite game can contain one or more finite games, a finite game cannot contain an infinite game. Modernity has chosen to exclusively focus on finite games. Finite games keeps us wrongly competitive, static, hostile, individualist, tribal, polarised, suspicious, miserable, and blindly heading for destruction. Infinite games lead us to be cooperative, dynamic, open, inclusive, ever-changing, engaged, and adaptive to whatever may come our way.</p>
<p>Life is an infinite game filled with finite games. James Carse again: "Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do". How much in your life feels like a decision taken for you, something you must do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Biased evidence selection.html">Biased evidence selection</a></strong> - How things are going for a finite player will be judged within and exclusively from the results of the finite game being played. The world outside of the arena might as well be on fire as long as we're in the lead.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Biodiversity loss.html">Biodiversity loss</a></strong> - Sadly, modern humans have decided to view evolution as a finite game with the victor being the one dominating species above all others.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Centralisation.html">Centralisation</a></strong> - Victors of the finite games of modern society tend to gain power and climb upwards to central points of decision-making. It is not surprising that the so-called development of our societies map onto the same finite-game structures that the decision-makers fought within to get their power.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Cognitive dissonance.html">Cognitive dissonance</a></strong> - Life becomes terribly difficult to live if you are unable to see the grander infinite games. However, within modernity it somtimes becomes more difficult when you clearly see the necessary finite games on lower levels seeming to oppose the grander games. I find the dissonance to be jarring most days.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - Finite games are too rigid to fit the infinity of a well-lived life and a properly handled civilisation. Remember, an infinite game can fit an infinite amount of finite games within it whereas a finite game doesn't fit that much more than itself.</li>

Today, most people are so caught up in finite games they either laugh or cry when getting a glimpse of the infinite game around them, perhaps in the glint of their children's eyes.</li>
