<title>Ignoring diversity</title>
<h2>Ignoring diversity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilisation.</p>
<br>Mahatma Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People, places, cultures, thoughts, opinions, beliefs, systems, values, rights, morals, ethics, are diverse, they're different. <strong>There will never be one way of life for all to follow</strong>, neither should there be. Equality must include diversity to be of value. The only functioning way for all of humanity to be the same is having the freedom to be different, to be diverse. <em>The next big thing will be many small things</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.</p>
<br>Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Agriculture.html">Agriculture</a></strong> - Different things grow in different places and different things should also grow in each place.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Architecture.html">Architecture</a></strong> - When all developments optimise similarly they all end up looking the same. Few things are of their place nowadays. I will, despite the negative tone of most predicaments, give an example of an exception, which is some of the newer buildings in central Amsterdam. They manage to be unashamedly modern while blending in with the surrounding buildings which are sometimes several centuries older. At least diversity got to play a part.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Deforestation.html">Deforestation</a></strong> - Being unaware of the diversity of life in an old forest compared with a newly planted one makes deforestation into a non-problem.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Ecological crisis.html">Ecological crisis</a></strong> - Eco-systems flow in time through constant change and diversification. We try, and fail, to impose permanence and sameness.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Educational crisis.html">Educational crisis</a></strong> - Turns out, shock surprise, humans aren't homogeneous lumps of plastic able to fill any mold. Is it an unpopular opinion that I don't think anyone should be able to become a doctor or an engineer just because they want to? I mean, I'm an engineer and I definitely shouldn't be one.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Lack of attentiveness.html">Lack of attentiveness</a></strong> - Of course, ignoring something blinds part of your attention. Even when unknowingly ignoring diversity, it narrows your width of attentiveness.</li>
