<title>Lack of systems thinking</title>
<h2>Lack of systems thinking</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The systems-thinking lens allows us to reclaim our intuition about whole systems and hone our abilities to understand parts, see interconnections, ask “what-if ” questions about possible future behaviors, and be creative and courageous about system redesign.</p>
<br>Donella Meadows</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems<em>thinking">Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts</a></strong>. Instead of trying to find singular causes or reductionistically define overall behaviour from the behaviour of subsystems, systems thinkers tend to look at a system's dynamics, complex behaviours, feedback loops, <a href="https://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage</em>Points.pdf">leverage points</a>, etc. Systems thinking is a requirement for understanding the complex connections between predicaments and how to manage them.</p>
<p>Those who do not apply systems thinking to their decisions and actions will constantly be unpleasantly surprised by the unpredictability of their results. Oh, systems thinkers will also have unpredictable results, they're just slightly less surprised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God grant us the serenity to exercise our bounded rationality freely in the systems that are structured appropriately, the courage to restructure the systems that aren’t, and the wisdom to know the difference!</p>
<br>Donella Meadows</p>
