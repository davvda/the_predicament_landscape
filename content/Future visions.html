<h2>Future visions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Four tasks</strong>: salvaging the good we can bring, mourning the good we cannot bring, noticing the things that were never as good as we were told, looking for the dropped threads that need to be woven back in.<br>
<strong>Four questions</strong>: What should we put to use before we lose it? What can we build now knowing that collapse is coming that will help us thrive in the ruins? What can we evolve from the dying system? What are the seeds of the things we mourn and how do we gather them, take them with us, and sow them for the future?</p>
