<title>Apathy</title>
<h2>Apathy</h2>
<p><strong>Apathy means the absence of suffering, lack of feelings, or passionlessness.</strong> More generally however, apathy means simply not caring or not experiencing any emotions. In this sense, apathy is opposed to sympathy (feeling for) and empathy (feeling with) and tends to go hand in hand with inaction, complicity, and passivity. What happens happens, I don't care.</p>
<p>To manage the predicament landscape we must learn to balance and find harmony between the mind and the heart. <em>Dare to care</em>.</p>
