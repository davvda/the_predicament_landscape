<title>Inertia</title>
<h2>Inertia</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia">Inertia is the tendency of objects in motion to stay in motion and objects at rest to stay at rest</a>. As a predicament, <strong>inertia is the unbudging nature of the trendlines and modes of being of modern civilisation</strong>. Through energy extraction and economic growth we've accelerated to such speeds that we seem unable to slow down and, if the engine was to stop, our inertia would keep us heading straight for the precipice. Inertia presents us with the fact that it wouldn't be enough to stop our negatively impacting actions, we would have to actively reverse their effects or prepare to recover from the crash.

Oftentimes, a better analogy is of a train colliding with a solid obsidian wall in slow motion. Or a tidal wave, already high above our heads, slowly rolling, darkening, crashing down.</li>

	<li><a href="Resources.html">Resources</a> - Want a tip? Sometimes, there are decent arguments for the slowing of the engines of modernity. The arguments tend to point at some sort of decoupling between wealth and energy or welfare and carbon emissions. That's great, really, good job. My tip is to compare alleged progress with resource use, especially material resources. Sweden is frequently raised as an example of an innovative nation acting as a good example of the enlightened wonders and ingenuity of modernity, and as a nation currently recirculates 3-4% of its material resources. </li>
