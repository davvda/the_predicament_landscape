<h2>Naive progress narrative</h2>
<p><strong>The current dominating mainstream narrative of humanity is a narrative of progress</strong>. Specifically, it tends to relate to technological innovation as a fundamental driver of history. Technology determines the fate of us all, from our entire modern civilisation to each individual, so the narrative claims. What does it mean to be naive in ones view of progress as opposed to having an intelligent and wise view of progress? And why does this narrative matter?</p>
<p>In the naïveté there hides several problems of scale or span, both in time and space. Certain fields and areas have undoubtedly seen much progress, however, it all depends on what is included in the word <em>progress</em>. If to progress is to <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/progress">move forward</a> it is valuable to understand what one is moving forward towards as well as what one is moving away from. Also, what is and is not included in this forward-movement?</p>
<p>Is the notion of progress at all useful for organisms? What would it mean for wolves or fungi to progress?</p>
