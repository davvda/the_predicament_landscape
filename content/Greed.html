<title>Greed</title>
<h2>Greed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>So the unwanting soul<br>
sees what's hidden,<br>
and the ever-wanting soul<br>
sees only what it wants.</p>
<br>Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Greed is complicated. It's often defined as the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/greed">excessively eager desire to possess</a> and is commonly talked about as one of the drivers of capitalism, the basic fundament of human nature. I would argue that <strong>greed is a response to fear of scarcity</strong>, either directly experienced scarcity in the present moment or projected into the future. Capitalism rewards accumulation, drives fear of scarcity, and generates and maintains greed. Greed is a capitalist virtue. In most religions and philosophies of life greed is spoken of as an unwholesome human characteristic, sinful, unwise, immature, ego-centred, harmful.</p>

<p>Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.</p>

There's a saying within the FIRE-movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) which says that "money works harder than you" in relation to the fact that your productivity and profit can never rise to that of compounding interest. Just to be very clear about this: money does not work at all. Geez, I'm pissed off today. And yes, I know many FIRE-people mostly want to avoid system-participation and wasting their lives in offices, I get it, but it's just very difficult to hear someone who drives a Tesla talk about hard work and frugality. Not that I'm better but I at least have the common sense to walk around with a heavy conscience and a downcast demeanor. Oh, and another thing. Don't "eat the rich" as the expression goes, their sweetness is artificial and bad for your gut microbiota. Just leave them in a corner somewhere with some finger paint and a copy of Being & Time.</li>
