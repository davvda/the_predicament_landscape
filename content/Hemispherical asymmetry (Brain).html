<title>Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)</title>
<h2>Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)</h2>
<p>In the words of Iain McGilchrist, the natural philosopher, scientist, and author of The Matter With Things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that nowadays we live no longer in the presence of the world, but rather in a re-presentation of it. The significance of that is that the left hemisphere’s task is to ‘re-present’ what first ‘presences’ to the right hemisphere. This re-presentation has all the qualities of a virtual image: an infinitely thin, immobile, fragment of a vast, seamless, living, ever-flowing whole. From a standpoint within the representation, everything is reversed. Instead of seeing what is truly present as primary, and the representation as a necessarily diminished derivative of it, we see reality as merely a special case of our representation – one in which something is added in to ‘animate’ it. In this it is like a ciné film that consists of countless static slices requiring a projector to bring it back into what at least looks to us like a living flow. On the contrary, however, reality is not an animated version of our re-presentation of it, but our re-presentation a devitalised version of reality. It is the re-presentation that is a special, wholly atypical and imaginary, case of what is truly present, as the filmstrip is of life – the re-presentation is simply what one might call the ‘limit case’ of what is real. Stepping out of this world-picture and into the world, stepping out of suspended animation and back into life, will involve inverting many of our perhaps cherished assumptions.</p>

<p>McGilchrist makes the case that <strong>the major underlying dynamic behind the issues of modernity lies in the left hemisphere having become the master of the right</strong>, as opposed to the more beneficial state where the right is master of the left. Both hemispheres and, more generally, all facets of the human mind are vital to our survival and becoming as living beings, but when our narrow representations of reality get to rule the present living world we are in deep trouble.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - The left hemisphere grasps each element too firmly to deal with totality.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Dogmatism.html">Dogmatism</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Educational crisis.html">Educational crisis</a></strong> - We're almost exclusively training the left hemisphere. If you feel unequipped to deal with the broad range of these predicaments, don't worry, I feel the same, but there's a higher voice within that sneers at the insecurities of our left-sided disabilities.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ego.html">Ego</a></strong> - Most of its heft on the left.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Finite games.html">Finite games</a></strong> - The left hemisphere deals with infinity by taking a big red crayon, drawing an eight on a piece of paper, and turning the paper 90 degrees. In a field nearby, the left hemisphere, a whirling dervish among the sunflowers.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth).html">Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)</a></strong> - As above, so below. As within, so without. A split brain creates a split world. The emissary has colonised the entire world. Where is the true master hiding?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignorance of interconnectedness.html">Ignorance of interconnectedness</a></strong> - The left hemisphere's view of reality is that atomic mechanistic particles make up the world.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignorance of the mystical.html">Ignorance of the mystical</a></strong> - Let me be a bit more diplomatic with regards to the left hemisphere for a second. I've given it quite a bashing. The left hemisphere is highly important. Just one clear example of this is that the mystical source (whatever I mean by that) of poetry (whatever I mean by that) is touched by and through the right hemisphere but the actual words written require the left hemisphere. The issue therefore arises when the right hemisphere never gets the free rein, opening onto the mystical, and the left hemisphere is left creating pivot tables in Microsoft Excel.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ignoring complexity.html">Ignoring complexity</a></strong> - The left hemisphere's need to clearly define and circle everything maps terribly onto the complexity of reality.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Illusion of competence.html">Illusion of competence</a></strong> - You know when you put your forehead on the end knob of a baseball bat and then spin around until you can barely stand? Yeah? Do that and sprint up the Dunning-Kruger-slope. You'll never notice how incompetent you are.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Individualism.html">Individualism</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of a living world view.html">Lack of a living world view</a></strong> - This here is the strongest predicament connection for our hemispherical imbalance and it is a devastating one. Then again, maybe a protective mechanism is in place where destroying a living world doesn't feel as serious when we see nothing as living.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Lack of love.html">Lack of love</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Lack of systems thinking.html">Lack of systems thinking</a></strong> - Systems thinking is an attempt to use left-brained means to form a right-brained view. It is a critical bridge for the thinking of our time.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Language.html">Language</a></strong> - It is so funny that the German language, grammatically well-oiled cogs in an industrial steam-apparatus, somehow works comparatively well for poetry.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Map and territory.html">Map and territory</a></strong> - Left deals only in maps, right has its feet planted on the ground while retaining its ability to soar above the clouds if needed.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Mind-body separation.html">Mind-body separation</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="Nihilism.html">Nihilism</a></strong> - We do not see the world as it is, we see it as we are. And if we look within and see nothing but nothing then that is what everything must be.</li>
