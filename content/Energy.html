<h2>Energy</h2>
<p><strong>Energy is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1#Ancient<em>Greek">activity and vigour</a>, energy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work</em>(thermodynamics">work</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat">heat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light">light</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-translation<em>symmetry">flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical</em>energy">electricity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound<em>energy">sound</a>.</strong> Energy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality</em>and_actuality">happiness, pleasure, and living force</a>. Energy is life and all life needs energy. How we get and use energy is the central predicament of existence. Less philosophically, we get our energy from the sun in different forms which we then use in order to live.</p>
