<h2>Racism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that <em>they</em> must accept <em>you</em>. The terrible thing, old buddy, is that <em>you</em> must accept <em>them.</em> And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know.</p>
<br>James Baldwin</p>

<p><strong>Racism is the discrimination of people based on their "race", appearance, ethnicity, or other, commonly visual and place-related, characteristics</strong>. It is also one of the more prevalent shortcuts to passing blame and striving for betterment. If <em>they</em> simply went away we'd be better off. Racism easily takes hold of ancient instincts to oppose strangers and be weary of people who appear different. This makes racism a suitable driving force for many political agendas, propaganda, and directing the rage of a people towards a common (non-)enemy.</p>
