<p><strong>A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that quickly spreads across a large region</strong>. Many aspects of modern civilisation make pandemics more likely, more globally affecting, and potentially more deadly. If something similar to the Spanish flu was to spread globally today there could be approximately 240 million deaths (looking at a 3% crude mortality rate) compared with the estimated deaths from COVID-19 at around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">19 to 36 million</a>.</p>
