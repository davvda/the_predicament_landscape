<title>Lack of communities</title>
<h2>Lack of communities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</p>
<br>African proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A community is often defined as a group of people sharing common interests</strong>. Communities, especially local ones consisting of people living in the same place, have become very rare indeed. If humans are evolutionarily unfit for modernity with its speed, complexity, and scale, what, then, about our modern way of living as individuals totally lacking anything resembling community?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.</p>
<br>Aboriginal activist group</p>

This is the entire holy life, Ānanda, that is, good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. When a bhikkhu has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path."
