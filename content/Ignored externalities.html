<title>Ignored externalities</title>
<h2>Ignored externalities</h2>
<p><strong>An externality is a cost or benefit caused by one party but incurred or received by another.</strong> It is important to think of externalities not just as financial. More generally then, externalities are events occurring as a byproduct of another event. Many (most?) externalities of the modern economy are ignored and following the connections of current predicaments it is not an unreasonable claim that most predicaments are externalities to the current economic system.</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p>
<p>Here follows an incomplete list of our ignored externalities and examples of what these externalities can stem from. In a sense, this list can act as a miniature predicament landscape in principle:</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Apathy.html">Apathy</a></strong> - Following the <strong><a href="News.html">News</a></strong> and "staying informed" might give people an illusion of caring that can in reality remove all sense of empathy.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Biased evidence selection.html">Biased evidence selection</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Social media.html">Social media</a></strong> and <strong><a href="Algorithmic curation.html">Algorithmic curation</a></strong> strike again.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Cars.html">Cars</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Architecture.html">Architecture</a></strong>, <strong><a href="Transportation infrastructure.html">Transportation infrastructure</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="Clock time.html">Clock time</a></strong> among others. We've knowingly and unknowingly designed our societies in order for cars to be necessities.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Climate change.html">Climate change</a></strong> - An ignored externality stemming from the very core of modernity? I suppose, if I must give a concrete example, climate change is an externality of our ways of extracting and distributing <strong><a href="Energy.html">Energy</a></strong> as well as our <strong><a href="Energy consumption increasing.html">Energy consumption increasing</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Cognitive dissonance.html">Cognitive dissonance</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Advertising.html">Advertising</a></strong> intends to create a dissonance that can be alleviated by a specific purchase. Pretty smart.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Complexity mismatch.html">Complexity mismatch</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Monocultures (people).html">Monocultures (people)</a></strong>. Even I thought I'd give the example of agricultural monocultures but I opted for the homogenisation of ways of being as people. As I'm sure has been written several times across this work, humans live in a sea of ways as fish live in a sea of water. The fewer ways that remain as optional paths, the less able we become to tackle novel challenges. So, yes, here we are. The highway to the abyss is paved with global index funds.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Democracy failing.html">Democracy failing</a></strong> - Whoops, who knew simply optimising digital services for user retention and engagement through <strong><a href="Algorithmic curation.html">Algorithmic curation</a></strong> could ruin democracy?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="Despair.html">Despair</a></strong> - <strong><a href="The Predicament Landscape.html">The Predicament Landscape</a></strong> and similar so-called doomer works. Sorry.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Disinformation.html">Disinformation</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Algorithmic curation.html">Algorithmic curation</a></strong> optimises for what's engaging, not necessarily for what is true. I will say, however, that were algorithms held responsible for judging what truth means... Well, that is just a whole different ballgame. Regardless of this, it has become much easier to spread disinformation widely because of these algorithms.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Ecological crisis.html">Ecological crisis</a></strong> - The eco-system is rarely included in discussions of <strong><a href="Big tech.html">Big tech</a></strong> <strong><a href="Investing.html">Investing</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Educational crisis.html">Educational crisis</a></strong> - <strong><a href="Social media.html">Social media</a></strong> and, funnily enough, our <strong><a href="Educational systems.html">Educational systems</a></strong>. Among others, of course. It's all vague borders and diffuse connections in reality, keep that in mind.</li>

<p>The case can be made for every predicament in this landscape being an ignored externality of something. You figure it out. Perhaps a better way of looking at this predicament's connections is looking which predicaments are most clearly unintentional ignored externalities? This is a tricky one. In a sense, this predicament makes it clear that there is a recursive nature to this landscape, unsurprisingly so since that is how reality comes to be, but complicating nonetheless in how it effects my ability to provide a satisfying explanation. Kurt, can I get some help here, please?</p>
