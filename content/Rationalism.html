<title>Rationalism</title>
<h2>Rationalism</h2>
<p><strong>Rationalism is the epistemological view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive</strong>. Rationalism and its main principles of logic, mathematics, and metaphysics are important tools for thinking but exclusive reliance on rational thinking risks the thinker ending up in a world of representation whose bonds with present reality are silently cut. The main method of ensuring the representations are grounded in reality is through science and quantification/mathematics which, as other predicaments detail, leads one to bias ones thinking towards what is quantifiable while having difficulty factoring in what isn't. It is important to note that rationalism in and of itself is not problematic. A lack of balance and an exclusive focus on rationalism as the be all and end all of the thinking process is what makes it into a current predicament. And remember, rationalisation is not rational. Rationalisation is having a conclusion and backfilling why that is the correct conclusion. Rationality should systematically do the opposite.</p>
