<h2>Data privacy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy"><strong>Data privacy is the principle that a person should have control over their personal data</strong>, including the ability to decide how organisations collect, store, and use their data</a>. For many corporations that develop digital services personal data is their main currency, allowing algorithmic curation to keep users watching, personalised ads to manipulate behaviour, as well as selling the data to other entities. The clash between users' naïveté and the sophistication of predictive models leads to corporations knowing more about users than the users might assume, even if almost no personal data is shared. Just analysing where on the page a user clicks can be enough for many models to predict certain behaviour or characteristics.</p>
