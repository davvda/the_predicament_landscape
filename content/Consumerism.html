<title>Consumerism</title>
<h2>Consumerism</h2>
<p>Consuming means <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/consume">using up</a>. <strong>Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the aspirations of individuals include using up more than is necessary for survival</strong>. Consumerism is mainly the result of free markets and the notion that <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism">the free choice of the consumers is what should orient the economic organisation of a society</a></strong>. Coincidentally, this gives companies a clear reason to blame the consumers for any externalities caused in the production of the products and services the consumers want and need. It isn't the companies fault that they just follow the will of the people, right?</p>

Are we so starved for attention and appreciation that we happily tattoo our favourite brands on our foreheads to cement who we truly are? Brands have managed to make <em>us</em> pay to market their products through consumption and identity-strengthening flaunting.</li>
