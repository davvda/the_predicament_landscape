<title>Inequality</title>
<h2>Inequality</h2>
<p>Inequality is, clearly, the negation of equality, which means something which is equal to, or the same as, something else. Inequality is then <strong>when something isn't the same as something else</strong>. It is only when we're treated the same that we're allowed our differences.</p>
<p>The modern, highly praised version of equality is the inclusion of everyone in the eternal climb to be better than others. A woman shouldn't be at home caring for children, mending clothes and cooking, rather, she should strive for the wealth and status that enables her to give that opportunity to someone further down the ladder, how generous of her. Inequality has been solved by making everyone equally inequal in one single hierarchical structure. However, even the equality of inequality is inequal since the ladder was built by and for white male hands and, furthermore, the higher up you are the easier it is to climb. Whoops. Oh well, nothing we can do about it now! Look at the cute poor ants down there, we should get one of those, Charles, they look so lively, full of vigour, bless them.</p>

Here's a hot tip for anyone currently looking to commit genocide but whose suggestion is frowned upon: start slowly expanding the rift between you and the people you want to get rid of, give it a couple of years and soon your people will return to you, a twinkle in their eyes, asking you innocently if you have any idea what to do about the situation.</li>

Most people partake in this crime, gladly. Choke on your own deep-fried tongues. No, sorry, it doesn't do to get too angry with hypocrites whose spines have long-since been liquefied. My bad.</li>

Of course, the movement has been narrowly successful and undoubtedly important but its striving for full equality based on fundamental differences seems... I'm not sure.
