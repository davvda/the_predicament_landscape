<h2>Laws</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Laws are spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught.</p>
<br>Honoré de Balzac</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Laws are sets of rules created and enforced by social or governmental systems in order to regulate the behaviours of populations</strong>. Are laws necessary? Some argue that without laws we are nothing but lost beasts. We have plenty of laws and we still appear to be quite lost and sufficiently vicious, at least in my eyes, sometimes because of certain laws. The way governments enforce laws and tackle violence and lawless behaviour is through a monopoly on violence and lawless behaviour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm glad mushrooms are against the law, because I took them one time, and you know what happened to me? I laid in a field of green grass for four hours going, "My God! I love everything." Yeah, now if that isn't a hazard to our country … how are we gonna justify arms dealing when we realize that we're all one?</p>
<br>Bill Hicks</p>
