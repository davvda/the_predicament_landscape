<title>Ignorance of the mythical</title>
<h2>Ignorance of the mythical</h2>
<p><strong>A myth is a narrative that plays a fundamental role in a culture</strong>. The ongoing narrative is largely based on the myth of the ascent of humanity, the narrative of progress and separation. It is generally not talked about that myths control much of the underlying dynamics of our civilisation. Myths are often fictions told as vaguely historical stories that explain how, why, and what the world is, has become, and/or will end. Forget our fundamental myths and you might just confuse them with reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myth is promiscuous, not dogmatic. It moves like a lively river through swarthy packs of reindeer, great aristocratic families, and the wild gestures of an Iranian carpet seller. Myth is not much to do with the past, but a kind of magical present that can flood our lives when the conditions are just so. It is not just the neurosis of us humans trying to fathom our place on earth, but sometimes the earth actually speaking back to us. That's why some stories can be hard to approach, they are not necessarily formed from a human point of view.</p>
