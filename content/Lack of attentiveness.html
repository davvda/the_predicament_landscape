<title>Lack of attentiveness</title>
<h2>Lack of attentiveness</h2>
<p>Being attentive means being observant, seeing changes in one's surroundings, noticing the needs and wants of others, being in service to others. <strong>To lack attentiveness is to not notice the effects of one's actions</strong>, to not be observant to changes in one's surroundings, to lack the care and tending to that the world requires from us.</p>
