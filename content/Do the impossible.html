<h2>Do the impossible</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>My other major takeaway from these collapse maps is that <strong>what works <em>after</em> a crisis event in a catabolic collapse will likely not have been <em>viable</em> before the crisis event.</strong><br>
Acknowledging the paradox of this, we find ourselves looking for ways to subvert and route around the logic of a self-destructing system – in full awareness that much of what will work as that system breaks is not "viable" so long as it holds. The medicine in this is that we don't need to feel embarrassed or ashamed at this lack of viability, but nor should we sweep it under the carpet. Instead, we're looking for "hacks" and "trickster moves" that make it possible to carry on activities that don't make sense under prevailing economic conditions.</p>
