<h2>Imprisonment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is said that no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.</p>
<br>Nelson Mandela</p>

<p><strong>Be enough of a problem for modernity and/or the ruling government of your place and you're sent off to prison</strong>, either until you can return as a part of the machinery or until you're deemed harmless to the global system. There also exist much more subtle forms of imprisonment, their membranes are only felt when you unwittingly bump against them.</p>
