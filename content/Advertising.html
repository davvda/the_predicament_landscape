<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Advertisements try to <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/advertisement">turn us and direct us</a> towards something, to affect our awareness of the world around us, generally with the purpose of having us buy or want something. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising">Advertising is the practice employed to bring attention to a product or service.</a></strong> It strains the imagination to think of a society without advertising.</p>

<p>It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase.</p>
