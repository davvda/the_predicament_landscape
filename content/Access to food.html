<title>Access to food</title>
<h2>Access to food</h2>
<p><strong>Access to food means having access to the necessary energy and nutrients to live.</strong> This means living in a place where one can grow fruits and vegetables, one can hunt or fish, raise livestock, forage and gather wild plants and fungi, or have food transported to one's location.</p>

<p>When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="Access to water.html">Access to water</a></strong> - Pretty clear connection. To grow food you need water. Also, there are people living close to thirsty avocado farms who don't always have access to neither water nor avocados.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="Addiction.html">Addiction</a></strong> - The constant ease by which we can reach out for sugar and fat, historically connected to nutrient-dense, hard-to-find food, leads to addictive behavior with regards to our eating habits.</li>
