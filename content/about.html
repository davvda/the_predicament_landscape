<p><s>Maybe <a href="https://ko-fi.com/punkistpoet">donate</a> some food to my dog Hilma?</s> I currently have a job so even if I still appreciate donations I would direct you to <a href="https://galgosdelsol.org/donate-help/">donate for me</a> instead of to me. Or <a href="mailto:david@punk.ist">send me an email</a>? Or check out <a href="http://www.punk.ist/">my other project</a> that started all this madness... Or maybe check my Swedish podcast <a href="https://annorlunda.buzzsprout.com/">Annorlunda</a>.</p>
