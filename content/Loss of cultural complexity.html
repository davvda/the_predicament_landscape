<title>Loss of cultural complexity</title>
<h2>Loss of cultural complexity</h2>
<p>Culture encompasses the social behaviours, norms, institutions, knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, capabilities, customs, individual habits, and more of groups in human societies. When most cultures fall into the same system the complexity of cultures overall will be reduced. <strong>The less cultural complexity the lower the chance that human societies can respond to societal disruptions</strong>. This loss of cultural complexity is two-sided. On one side we have a reduction in the complexity of each culture since behaviours, norms, etc must follow the requirements of the global economic systems. In other words, the cultures that exist are becoming more similar, somehow while continuing to polarise, a paradox for another time. The other side is the complete disappearing of cultures that begun with the start of colonialism which continues to this day, with people dying together with their culture.</p>
