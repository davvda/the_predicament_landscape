<title>Carbon fundamentalism</title>
<h2>Carbon fundamentalism</h2>
<p>The dominating proxy for climate change has become carbon or, rather, <strong>CO2e</strong>. Becoming "carbon neutral" seems to be the main goal for many corporations and nations. Putting doubts about the truth of that claim aside, we could probably become carbon neutral or even carbon negative and still continue our vociferous dive into a lifeless, dystopian, scorched earth abyss. Don't get me wrong, carbon dioxide emissions are likely the main cause of global warming and overall climate change, but being the cause and being the driver are two very different things. We will definitely have to dramatically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, preferably 50 years ago, but the second best time to plant a tree yadda yadda, however, it will not suffice as a solution to global warming, climate change, or any other predicament. But of course, if you are against domestic abuse and you are currently beating your partner to death, it's a good plan to stop, but it's just the start of the healing process. If healing is what you want, that is.</p>
