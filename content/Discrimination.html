<h2>Discrimination</h2>
<p><strong>Discrimination is the process of making distinctions between others based on the categories they belong or are perceived to belong to</strong>. It is a furthering of the forcing of separation and division that modernity excels at.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="Dispositionism.html">Dispositionism</a></strong> - Dispositionism is often rooted in and driven by acts of discrimination. Unfortunately, the behaviours following these acts frequently deepen the dispositions held by the discriminators, further justifying both the discrimination and the dispositionist view. If you believe a certain type of person is violent and take extra precautions against this violence, enough so that the person feels the world closing in on him, it is likely he'll turn violent. This is a great oppressive strategy that acts to justify unjust rule.</li>

What leads to what? How many are discriminated because of inherently criminal tendencies and how many turn to crime because of discrimination? My money is on most prisoners being in the second category. Why did I write "inherently criminal tendencies"? Now, what the hell does that mean? The law is not a law of nature.</li>

And how does it change them when allowed to be included on the condition that they're translated into English? What is lost? Are you fortunate enough to speak a "non-Western" language? Do you notice a difference between your breadth of thinking compared with a native English-speaker who only speaks English? To take this even further, with the noun-dominance of English I wonder how much our languages are to blame for our discriminatory tendencies...</li>
