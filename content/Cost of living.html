<title>Cost of living</title>
<h2>Cost of living</h2>
<p><strong>The cost of living is the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living</strong>. The constant need to pay the cost of living keeps many people away from life. <a href="https://wir2022.wid.world/">The bottom half, the poorest, of the global population owns 2% of global wealth, while the top 1% owns 38%</a>. When the cost of living is high compared to one's income it then becomes impossible to acquire wealth and, together with the debt from loans, one ends up in a situation that completely lacks agency and optionality, where there is no way out but to keep earning, keep owing, keep paying.</p>
