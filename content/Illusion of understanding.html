<p>To understand is to have a deeply rooted foundation <strong>under</strong>neath where one <strong>stands</strong>. True <strong>understanding cannot be explained or boiled down to concepts or models</strong>, they only reach the shallow top layer. True understanding and the understanding of truths lies beyond the verbal and explainable. Modern civilisation is, unfortunately, unknowingly, constantly conflating explanations with understanding.</p>
<p>As a predicament, the illusion of understanding presents us with a world that never makes real sense with the explanations we have, it doesn't behave the way we expect or want. In short, everything is infinitely more complex than we can know, and because it is comforting and often useful to place the world within the frames of concepts, models, principles, and laws, we end up with an illusion of understanding the world, missing that it stretches outside of the frames, endlessly in all directions.</p>

With our ways of explaining, modelling, framing, and consequently reducing all knowledge to fit within these frames, we lose the whole, the interconnectedness of what we believe we understand. The deeply rooted foundations I mention can often be the very connections between all things, every thought and idea rooted in the whole.</li>
