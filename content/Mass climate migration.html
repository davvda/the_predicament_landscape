<title>Mass climate migration</title>
<h2>Mass climate migration</h2>
<p>A case, and quite a convincing one at that, can be made that t<strong>he majority of migration of the past few hundred years have been related to climate change</strong>.</p>
<p>The Syrian refugee crisis saw around a million Syrians coming to Europe. This created enormous political tension, increased racism, furthering of right extremism, and is still seen as the major destabilising event in countries that decided to host a large portion of Syrian refugees, like Germany and Sweden. By 2050 it is estimated that at least <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/climate-refugees-the-world-s-forgotten-victims/">1.2 billion people</a> could be displaced by climate-related events. If humanity fails to coordinate around climate migration or, at the very least, navigate the chaotic inclusion of those whose displacement we've caused, unprecedented disaster awaits.</p>
