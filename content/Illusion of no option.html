<title>Illusion of no option</title>
<h2>Illusion of no option</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>...humans live and act in ways as fish live and act in water. We don’t notice in how many <em>ways</em> we depend on <em>ways</em>. Being in a sea of ways is being human.</p>
<br>Chuang Tzu</p>

<p><strong>The illusion of no option means a false belief that there are no other ways but the current way of doing things</strong>. So called capitalist realism is a type of illusion of no option which says that there are no functioning economic systems besides capitalism. We have no choice but to grow, extract, fight, use violence, use fossil fuels, be profitable, hire more scrum masters, enforce national borders, eat meat, use generative AI, earn money to pay rent, travel, invest, participate, and the list could go on forever. We live in a world structured by models and systems created by humans and these can, whether it appears that way or not, be changed.</p>
