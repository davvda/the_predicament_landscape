<title>Distractions</title>
<h2>Distractions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Half an hour's meditation each day is essential, except when you are busy. Then a full hour is needed.</p>
<br>Saint Francis de Sales</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Distractions draw us in different directions and pull us apart</strong>, even when it goes largely unseen, we're diverted and bewildered. Distractions keep us on the surface, hinders us from reflection and contemplation, protects us from difficulties lurking in the depths. It also makes us miss life in the midst of living. Distractions provide an alternative to experiencing life.</p>
