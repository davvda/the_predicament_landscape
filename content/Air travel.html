<title>Air travel</title>
<h2>Air travel</h2>
<p><strong>Air travel is the movement of people between different geographical locations using air vehicles</strong>, most commonly airplanes. It is the fastest mode of transportation and it makes, in good ways and bad, the world smaller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Away and away the aeroplane shot,<br>
till it was nothing but a bright spark; an aspiration;<br>
a concentration;<br>
a symbol... of man's soul; of his determination...<br>
to get outside his body.</p>
<br>Virginia Woolf</p>
