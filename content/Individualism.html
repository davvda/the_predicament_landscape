<h2>Individualism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Birds born in cages think that flying is a disease.</p>

<p><strong>Individualism emphasises the intrinsic worth of the individual</strong>, the singular person. Individualism has become a predicament more because of the things it doesn't do rather than the things it does. Its focus on individual goal-achieving, self-reliance, and independence only become an issue when taken to extremes in opposition to collective welfare, community, interdependence, and broader awareness of one's belonging and contributions. What is freedom?</p>
