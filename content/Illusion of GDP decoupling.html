<title>Illusion of GDP decoupling</title>
<h2>Illusion of GDP decoupling</h2>
<p>GDP decoupling tends to mean the decoupling of GDP (or growth) from carbon emissions. Taking a broader view would mean <strong>decoupling GDP from any long-term detrimental externalities</strong>. Taking an even broader view could mean increasing global welfare without increasing long-term detrimental externalities and, despite the predicament's title, this is not an unreasonable goal for humanity to have for the coming years, ideally maintaining or increasing welfare while decreasing externalities. Now that is an impressive optimisation challenge if I've ever seen one.</p>

The Paris agreement is already fucked and was never seriously intended to begin with... Nevertheless, "the emission reductions that high-income countries achieved through absolute decoupling fall far short of Paris-compliant rates. At the achieved rates, these countries would on average take more than 220 years to reduce their emissions by 95%, emitting 27 times their remaining 1·5°C fair-shares in the process. To meet their 1·5°C fair-shares alongside continued economic growth, decoupling rates would on average need to increase by a factor of ten by 2025."
