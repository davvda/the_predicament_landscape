<blockquote>
<p>The goal of our life’s effort is to reach the other shore, Nirvana. Prajna paramita, the true wisdom of life, is that in each step of the way, the other shore is actually reached.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A practice is the disciplined repetition of what you know with enough experimentation in that repetition to unlock those things you don’t yet know.</p>
