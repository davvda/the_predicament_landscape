<title>Hyperstimuli</title>
<h2>Hyperstimuli</h2>
<p><strong>Hyperstimuli, or supernormal stimuli, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus">exaggerated versions of a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which it evolved</a></strong> or an artificial version of a stimulus eliciting the same response but lacking the commonly related substance.</p>
<p>Junk food, pornography, media, travel, advertisements, AI-generated content, etc can all be classified as hyperstimuli. Hyperstimuli make us crave the artificial while being disastrous for mental health and the overall development of societies with well-functioning humans. We have developed strong responses to specific stimuli based on what these stimuli tend to give us. Sugar and fat tends to be coupled with nutritious food and has historically required much work to acquire, sex tends to be coupled with intimacy and a strengthening of social bonds. Refined sugar gives us the dopaminergic response without either the nutritional reward or the required work. Pornography gives us the physical response we get from sex without the intimacy.</p>
