<h2>Ignorance of interconnectedness</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.</p>
<cite>Bill Hicks</cite>
</blockquote><p>Many seem to be completely ignorant of the interconnectedness of the world. I suppose this isn't unexpected when we are taught and conditioned by a system that holds each individual as just that, individual. </p><p>When we cut off our roots to the Earth we can finally run free. Free from what? Where will we go? <strong>A rootless tree will be felled by the weakest gust of wind</strong>.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
