<h2>Reductionism</h2>
<p><strong>Reductionism describes the behaviour of systems in terms of the systems&#39; parts</strong>. Another way of looking at it is that reductionism attempts a bottom-up approach to understanding, for example trying to describe minds through the interactions of neurons, as opposed to holism which attempts to understand the system as a whole apart from the properties of its component parts. Reductionism is so deeply ingrained into our way of thinking in the modern world that we often mistake its mechanistic explanations for true understanding, leading to our incredible ability to manipulate the very building blocks of the universe with complete ignorance of why undesirable behaviour <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergentism">emerges</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing, and dance, and write poems, and suffer, and understand, for all that is life.</p>
