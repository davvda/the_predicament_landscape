<h2>Malnutrition</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.</p>
<cite>Hippocrates</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Malnutrition is a deficiency, excess, or imbalance of energy, protein, and other vital nutrients</strong>. Malnutrition therefore includes both starvation and obesity and it is estimated that around 30% of the global population has some form of malnutrition. With our knowledge of diet and the excess of available food it is nothing less than a tragedy that we have failed completely in getting nutrition right. Rest assured that it is not simply an unfortunate coincidence or personal failings, rather it is rooted in the many underlying systems of modernity.</p><p>Malnutrition, away from definitions, can also include factors that are more difficult to quantify. The food we eat make up who we become and this includes the soil it grows in, the air that surrounds it, how it was cooked, who cooked it, the bacteria it contains, the way its eaten, etc. Many revolutions have been started at a dinner table.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
