			<h2>Surveillance</h2>
			<p><strong>Surveillance is the monitoring of activities and information for the purpose of influencing and managing</strong>. With the development of information technology and social media surveillance has become more sophisticated and, for most people, non-obvious. A security camera watching you has a clear purpose and is often visible to those being watched. An algorithm trying to predict behaviour from the movements of a mouse cursor is a very different story. </p>
