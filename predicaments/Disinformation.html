<h2>Disinformation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How gullible are you? Is your gullibility located in some "gullibility center" in your brain? Could a neurosurgeon reach in and perform some delicate operation to lower your gullibility, otherwise leaving you alone? If you believe this, you are pretty gullible, and should perhaps consider such an operation.</p>
<cite>Douglas Hofstadter</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Disinformation is the deliberate deception of an audience through the spreading of false information</strong>, most often for political or commercial purposes. It is an attempt at removing truthful information in favour of manipulation and polarisation.</p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
