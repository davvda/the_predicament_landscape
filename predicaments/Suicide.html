<h2>Suicide</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate reality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream.</p>
<cite>The Bhagavad Gita</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Suicide is the deliberate killing of oneself</strong>. Beware the silent solace and solitude of those seagrass meadows swaying like manes under the frosted surface of the rivers of death. </p><blockquote>
<p>You are but a droplet in a waterfall, don't rush the remerge, I'll meet you again somewhere, there is a house on an island, I think I saw laundry swaying too, in the wind, on a string tied between the porch and the oak, you know that oak, there was a cat warm purring slow tail, it surely lived, I smell coffee, meet me there, we can talk, or if nothing else, there is a patch under the oak, a patch of moss, it has your prints on it, don't go just yet.</p>
