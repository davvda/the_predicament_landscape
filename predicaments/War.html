<h2>War</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems now that I was so near to that war.<br>
	I was born eight years after it ended<br>
	When the General Strike had been defeated.<br>
	<br>
	Yet I was born by Very Light and shrapnel<br>
	On duck boards<br>
	Among limbs without bodies.<br>
	<br>
	I was born of the look of the dead<br>
	Swaddled in mustard gas<br>
	And fed in a dugout.<br>
	<br>
	I was the groundless hope of survival<br>
	With mud between finger and thumb<br>
	Born near Abbeville.<br>
	<br>
	I lived the first year of my life<br>
	Between the leaves of a pocket bible<br>
	Stuffed in a khaki haversack.<br>
	<br>
	I lived the second year of my life<br>
	With three photos of a woman<br>
	Kept in a standard issue army paybook.<br>
	<br>
	In the third year of my life<br>
	At 11am on November 11th 1918<br>
	I became all that was conceivable.<br>
	<br>
	Before I could see<br>
	Before I could cry out<br>
	Before I could go hungry<br>
	<br>
	I was the world fit for heroes to live in.</p>

</blockquote><p><strong>A war is a violent conflict between two or more entities</strong>. Wars can have many purposes but the most common is for the victorious to become more powerful and the defeated to either become powerless or to be vanquished completely. Most modern warfare consists of proxy-wars between the most powerful on a global stage of assumed unimportant destruction, nowadays this lethal drama is set in the Middle East.</p><blockquote>

	<li><strong><a href="../Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a></strong> - War tends to accelerate several processes. There are perhaps two main reasons. One, close to entire populations and work forces suddenly focus on one thing only. The development and manufacturing of certain technologies benefit greatly from this monofocus. Many technological innovations have come from the need and desire to win wars. Secondly, war completely destroys any argument in favour of precautionary principles. Full steam ahead, you magnificent beast.</li>

Oh, never mind. War seems to confirm our views of human nature, the same views used to justify starting wars in the first place. Civilise the savages.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Identity.html">Identity</a></strong> - A country's identity is often cemented through its warfare against a common enemy. What are you, a god damned communist?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Limits to growth.html">Limits to growth</a></strong> - Global economic growth has in a sense halted global scale warfare, but how does this change when growth ends? How does war become a limit to or a controller of growth? Many unanswered (unanswerable?) questions here.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Loss of cultural complexity.html">Loss of cultural complexity</a></strong> - Cultures perish in all wars and are silently buried with the others.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Modern slavery.html">Modern slavery</a></strong> - Soldiers are slaves for higher powers. They might not feel like it. That's the point. An African-American picking cotton for his owner, chasing a future of imagined heroism and tales of glory, now that's successful conditioning.
