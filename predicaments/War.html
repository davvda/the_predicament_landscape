<h2>War</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>War is only a cowardly escape from the problems of peace.</p>
<cite>Thomas Mann</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>A war is a violent conflict between two or more entities</strong>. Wars can have many purposes but the most common is for the victorious to become more powerful and the defeated to either become powerless or to be vanquished completely. Most modern warfare consists of proxy-wars between the most powerful on a global stage of assumed unimportant destruction, nowadays this lethal drama is set in the Middle East.</p><blockquote>
<p>War is the ultimate tool of politics.</p>
<cite>R. Buckminster Fuller</cite>
