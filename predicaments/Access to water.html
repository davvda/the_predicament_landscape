<title>Access to water</title>
<h2>Access to water</h2>
<p>Access to water means just that. <strong>Water for drinking, washing, hearing, seeing, feeling, swimming, fishing, living in and with</strong>. I want you to imagine your favourite body of water. Maybe a gurgling creek, a calm forest lake, a beach with crashing waves, whatever comes to mind. In your mind's eye, what do you see? Look around, look at the water's surface, if you see anything underneath, the movement or stillness of the water, what it reflects, how it refracts, if other animals are interacting with it, if anything is disturbing its flow or stillness. What do you hear? What do you smell? Imagine it in as much detail as you can or, even better, actually go there. Now listen to this: "Water is an inorganic compound which is transparent, tasteless, and odorless". Wow, the poetry of modernity sure is striking. No wonder we're so happy.</p>

<p>Access to water is access to life, bursting with colour, the taste of the freshness of being, the scent of endless rebirth.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.<br>
After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.</p>
