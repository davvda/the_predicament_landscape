<h2>Naive techno-optimism</h2>
<p><strong>Techno-optimists tend to believe that all problems can be solved by new technology, including the problems created by previous technologies</strong>, given enough time. Everything is an engineering problem requiring the proper technological fix. This tends to be coupled with the view that technological innovation is created by private enterprise and funded through capitalist means. This coupling is important due to the fact that technology <em>isn&#39;t</em> value neutral and will follow the values of its investors and believers. </p>
