			<h2>Lack of visions</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>We cannot know his legendary head<br>
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso<br>
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,<br>
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,<br><br>

gleams in all its power. Otherwise<br>
the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could<br>
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs<br>
to that dark center where procreation flared.<br><br>

Otherwise this stone would seem defaced<br>
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders<br>
and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:<br><br>

would not, from all the borders of itself,<br>
burst like a star: for here there is no place<br>
that does not see you. You must change your life.</p>
<cite>Rainer Maria Rilke, Archaic Torso of Apollo</cite>

			<p><strong>There has occurred a narrowing of the future, a closing off</strong>. Instead of a future open with possibilities and visions of beauty, we seem resigned to the direction of our inertia. The visions that do exist seem hubristic and speaks to an ever shrinking minority of optimistic elites. Few people envision a distant future of peace, prosperity, beauty, wisdom, science, brilliance, love, community, friendship, and coherence. Is the future so dark that it denies vision? We must then withdraw from the order of events and create visions whose light comes from within, see them before they&#39;re visible. </p>
