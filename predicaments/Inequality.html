			<h2>Inequality</h2>
			<p>Inequality is, clearly, the negation of equality, which means something which is equal to, or the same as, something else. Inequality is then <strong>when something isn&#39;t the same as something else</strong>. It is only when we&#39;re treated the same that we&#39;re allowed our differences.</p>
<p>The modern, highly praised version of equality is the inclusion of everyone in the eternal climb to be better than others. A woman shouldn&#39;t be at home caring for children, mending clothes and cooking, rather, she should strive for the wealth and status that enables her to give that opportunity to someone further down the ladder, how generous of her. Inequality has been solved by making everyone equally inequal in one single hierarchical structure. However, even the equality of inequality is inequal since the ladder was built by and for white male hands and, furthermore, the higher up you are the easier it is to climb. Whoops. Oh well, nothing we can do about it now! Look at the cute poor blackies down there, they look like tiny little ants, oh, one just fell, how funny, Charles, did you see that, we should get one of those, they look so lively, full of vigour, bless them. </p>
