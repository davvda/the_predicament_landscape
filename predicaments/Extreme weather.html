<h2>Extreme weather</h2>
<p><strong>Extreme weather is any weather condition at the extremes of whatever has been observed and recorded in the past</strong> and includes heat waves, cold waves, storms, etc.</p>
<p>The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as &quot;an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of &#39;rare&#39; vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.&quot;</p>
<p>Human activity is most likely the main driver of the increased frequency of extreme weather events. </p>
<p>Extreme weather can also act as warnings and omens. Will we listen?</p>
