			<h2>Monocultures (people)</h2>
			<p>When one culture spreads across the world it becomes important to fall in line with the norm of that culture, resulting in an increasingly homogeneous singular monoculture where differences become causes for concern. <strong>Human monocultures are, just as agricultural ones, wholly incapable of survival in novel challenging situations</strong>, completely lacking complex responses to complex circumstances.</p>
