<h2>Modern slavery</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceased to be a man.</p>
<cite>Frederick Douglass</cite>
</blockquote><p>It is estimated that there are about 50 million people living in conditions of modern slavery. Modern slavery is, according to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/#the-scale" class="external-link" href="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/#the-scale" target="_blank">Walk Free</a>, "<strong>situations of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception</strong>". I would, with this definition in mind, potentially increase their estimate quite a bit but let it be enough to say that slavery is not a thing of the past, it might even be at its historical peak. </p><blockquote>
<p>Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves.</p>
