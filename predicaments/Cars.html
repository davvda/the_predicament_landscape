			<h2>Cars</h2>
			<p>The car, or automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels that started to replace the horse-drawn carriage in the early 1900s and has since then become perhaps the main invention deciding on the building scale of most places created by humans; nations, cities, villages. The car made it possible to travel further distances in less time leading to everything expanding out from ones home according to the timescales of driving instead of walking, biking, or riding. </p>
			<p>The emissions from cars make up <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector">10-20% of global CO2 emissions</a> depending on what is being included and <a href="https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-002-En.pdf">close to a third of all primary microplastics released into the oceans</a>. More land is required for roads and parking lots, there are few places without traffic noise, and traffic collisions are <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/world-report-on-road-traffic-injury-prevention">the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide</a>. </p>
			<p>If you have a dog, cat, or a combat wombat, imagine that it ran away from home. If there were no cars, what dangers are there?</p>
