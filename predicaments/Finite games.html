<h2>Finite games</h2>
<p>There are, according to James Carse, two kinds of games. <strong>Finite games are played for the purpose of winning</strong> and infinite games for the purpose of continuing the play. An infinite game can contain one or more finite games, a finite game cannot contain an infinite game. Modernity has chosen to exclusively focus on finite games. Finite games keeps us wrongly competitive, static, hostile, individualist, tribal, polarised, suspicious, miserable, and blindly heading for destruction. Infinite games lead us to be cooperative, dynamic, open, inclusive, ever-changing, engaged, and adaptive to whatever may come our way.</p>
<p>Life is an infinite game filled with finite games. James Carse again: &quot;Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do&quot;. How much in your life feels like a decision taken for you, something you must do?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.</p>
