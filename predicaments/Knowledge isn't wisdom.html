			<h2>Knowledge isn't wisdom</h2>
			<p>One can know a lot and wholly lack wisdom. Some might sneer at the notion of wisdom, comparing the high seat of knowledge that modern science and reasoning is built upon with the purported &quot;wisdom&quot; of primitive dead peoples. Rest assured that wisdom lies above knowledge as <strong>wisdom entails the direction of action based on knowledge, experience, understanding, and insight</strong>. Knowledge tells us nothing of what to do or why. It is, rather, an awareness of certain stated facts, models, concepts, principles, or explanations. Don&#39;t get me wrong, knowledge is of the utmost importance but it is nothing without wisdom. The two should never be confused.</p>
