			<h2>Lack of belonging</h2>
			<p><strong>Do you belong somewhere?</strong> Do the birds miss you when they leave before the first snow? Do the fields wonder where your footprints strayed when you&#39;re away? Is the moonlight in search of your shadow when you&#39;re gone? Does the sun rise hesitatingly, wonder whether to start the day before you&#39;ve arrived? </p>
<p>Few of us modern humans can imagine the feeling of belonging that has dominated most of our species&#39; history, I sure can&#39;t. Sometimes I feel a hint of it, like a drop of brackish water on the tip of my tongue, promising an ocean of eternal belonging somewhere beyond the archipelago.</p>
<p>We, as humans, require our people, our place, and a clarity of our role in it all. Most importantly, away from all abstraction, we require a feeling of belonging.</p>
