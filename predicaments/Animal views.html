<h2>Animal views</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.</p>
<cite>Mahatma Gandhi</cite>
</blockquote></div><div><p dir="auto">The Abrahamic religions put us, contrary to most spiritual precedents, in a garden where animals where then placed alongside us to be in our service. These religions didn't necessarily start this but they contain clear mythologies of our historical thinking. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">As our civilisation has become increasingly sophisticated (bunny ears on that one, I suppose) our views on other animals have become increasingly barbaric. It is important to note that the animal rights movement isn't something new. Jainism and its concept of ahimsa (refraining from the destruction of life) is around 3000 years old and animistic traditions reach back to, and might even in some ways precede, the rise of humans. <strong>Different animal views than ours are not just possible, they're historically more common and less complicated to justify</strong>.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Connections:</p></div><div><ul>
