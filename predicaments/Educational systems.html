<h2>Educational systems</h2>
<p><strong>Many educational systems are more about indoctrination and training than cultivating understanding</strong>. Education should create dependable, predictable, and productive humans for the global systems of commerce and civilisational expansion. In a world where, for our continued survival, we must question everything we thought we knew, the educational system will always be several steps behind, discouraging any curiosity to leave the boundaries of the curriculum. The mental tools that can make sure that the world of your grandchildren isn&#39;t destroyed or dystopian is nowhere in the curriculum, sorry &#39;bout that.</p>
