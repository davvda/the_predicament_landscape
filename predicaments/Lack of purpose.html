<h2>Lack of purpose</h2>
<p>What does it mean to have a purpose or, perhaps more importantly, to lack purpose? <strong>A purpose is an intention, aim, or goal</strong>. It is something put forth, proposed, something to be kept in view, the proper and unique reason for something&#39;s existence. Do you have a purpose? Do humans have a purpose? What about other beings? What about the sun? Whatever one answers to these questions it will shape the world one inhabits, make something of it and with it, and allow for the presence of some purposes and the absence of others. If you share humanity&#39;s lack of purpose in general, maybe there is a meta-purpose in living with the question of what the proper reason for ones own and humanity&#39;s existence could be?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who made the world?<br>
Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br>
Who made the grasshopper?<br>
This grasshopper, I mean-<br>
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br>
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br>
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down-<br>
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.<br>
Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br>
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br>
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br>
which is what I have been doing all day.<br>
Tell me, what else should I have done?<br>
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br>
Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br>
with your one wild and precious life?</p>
