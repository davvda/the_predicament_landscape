<h2>Limits to growth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate meaning to which all stories refer has two faces: the continuity of life, the inevitability of death.</p>
<cite>Italo Calvino</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>There are limits to growth in a finite system</strong>. What happens in the interaction between Earth's and humanity's systems when humanity tries to grow indefinitely?</p><p>Lets look at what the limits might be. The Limits to Growth report bases their model on five variables: population, food production, industrialisation, pollution, and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources. I think an even simpler way of looking at limits to growth is looking at input requirements and output management. If a set of systems requires an input of finite resources larger than the renewal of that resource it will deplete that resource. Also, if a set of systems produces waste that is larger than it can manage through reuse, recycling, or removal it will eventually cause irreversible disruption.</p><p>The Limits to Growth further concludes that if growth continues the most probable result is rapid, sudden, and uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity; that <em>it is possible</em> to alter these growth trends to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is indefinitely sustainable; and that the chances of succeeding in altering these trends increase the earlier we start striving for it. This report was written in 1972.</p><blockquote>
<p>These conclusions are so far-reaching and raise so many questions for further study that we are quite frankly overwhelmed by the enormity of the job that must be done. We hope that this book will serve to interest other people, in many fields of study and in many countries of the world, to raise the space and time horizons of their concerns, and to join us in understanding and preparing for a period of great transition&nbsp;â€“ the transition from growth to global equilibrium.</p>
<cite>The Limits to Growth</cite>
</blockquote><p>The Limits to Growth report has been criticised from many angles and there are of course important additions such as the effect of technological development on the possibilities for further growth. The problem with the technology argument is treated in other predicaments but put simply when related to the limits to growth, we will not escape the fact that humans need resources and a way to manage its waste and we are not closer to solving this with technology now than we were during the writing of the original 1972 report.</p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
