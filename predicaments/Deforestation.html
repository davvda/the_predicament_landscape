<h2>Deforestation</h2>
<p><strong>Deforestation is the removal and destruction of forests</strong>. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation">The UN FAO estimate that 10 million hectares of forest are cut down each year.</a> Two points of importance: one is that there is a difference between deforestation and net forest loss since forests are also regrowing and being replanted, second is that deforestation peaked in the 1980s. It is, however, also important to note that not all forests are equal and here we run into the potential issue with relying too heavily on quantification. We could most likely make most of the planet net positive in forest growth quite quickly by planting trees faster than we&#39;re removing them. The question is if we have a reason to trust our claimed understanding of the differences between artificially planted forests and naturally growing ones. Maybe we do? Do we truly understand what a forest is or are we missing it for all the trees?</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>There was a time when man* would walk in my woods, but now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things. <br>
		---<br>
		I am not altogether on anybodyâ€™s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.
