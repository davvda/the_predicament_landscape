<h2>Weber's iron cage</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter's view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the "saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment". But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.</p>
<cite>Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</cite>
</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, <strong><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage" target="_blank">Weber's iron cage is the need for narrow specialisation of work and the focus of enterprises and organisations to maximise profits and increase efficiency</a></strong> in present-day institutionalised capitalism. It is what traps us all in the requirement to keep the wheel spinning if we want to be a part of a civilisation whose partaking is no longer optional. We must work, we must profit, we must grow, we must accept bureaucracy and rationalisation as our inescapable fate. </p><blockquote>
<p>...specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilization never before achieved.</p>
<cite>Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</cite>
