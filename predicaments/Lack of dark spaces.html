<h2>Lack of dark spaces</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars. "There is the blueprint," they say.</p>
<cite>Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities</cite>
</blockquote><p>I wonder how common it is in the history of humans to feel safer at night when the stars <em>aren't</em> visible. Somehow, I sense an obvious issue in that <strong>the more we brighten the darkness, the more threatening the darkness becomes</strong>, as if we're condensing the beings of darkness, pushing them into the few remaining cramped corners. Unfortunately for us, the less we accept the night, embrace the darkness, the more it seeps into us, corrupts our actions and refracts our rays of thought. Beware the lack of dark spaces, it flatters you not but strengthens your shadow.</p><blockquote>
<p>The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty’s ends.</p>
<cite>Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, In Praise of Shadows</cite>
