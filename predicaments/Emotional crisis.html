			<h2>Emotional crisis</h2>
			<p>What stirs us up, agitates us? <strong>An emotional crisis is a state in which we are stirred up and agitated</strong>, internally and externally, to the extent that we lose control over our emotions and consequently the behaviours they might entail. Emotional crises could be expressed as depressive behaviours, anxiety, withdrawal, isolation, panic, paranoia, despair, sadness, anhedonia, and suicide. Defined differently it can also be seen as any state of crisis where emotions play a role in inhibiting proper responses, responsivity, or responsibility, potentially through situations being so complex that it becomes nearly impossible to know what a correct emotional reaction could be. </p>
