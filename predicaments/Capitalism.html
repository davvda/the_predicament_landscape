<h2>Capitalism</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism">Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development occurs through the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market</a></strong>. Capitalism, when it is combined with technological developments and increased energy availability, is probably the main concrete driver behind many of our problems, their current solutions and, importantly, one of the reasons for much of our increased material standard of living. As with most predicaments in the landscape it is crucial to identify, not what to reject, but how to balance the good with the bad for long-term thriving. There is plenty to criticise with the system of capitalism but this has to be done factoring in what it has done well in an attempt to bring that with us into whatever systems we choose as the alternative. For capitalism to continue in its current form there must be (more or less) infinite growth and with us approaching several planetary boundaries, and having passed many of them, growth is currently not a viable option, meaning capitalism most likely isn&#39;t one either, at least not in its current form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.</p>
<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin</cite>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>...all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the moneychangers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal.</p>
<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin</cite>
