			<h2>Healthcare</h2>
			<p>Calm down, hear me out. Modern healthcare is, in many ways, rightfully placed at the top of modern human achievement. There are about a billion asterisks to this statement, mainly consisting of arguments about the failure of accepting illness, suffering, pain, and death as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis">iatrogenic diseases</a> etc... But nonetheless, modern healthcare might be a reason why I can write this and why you can read it. So what&#39;s the problem, or rather, what&#39;s the predicament in modern healthcare? Once again, it is an issue with balance, optimisation, and the exclusion of non-quantifiable aspects of health. Let&#39;s look at an example.</p>
<p>Healthcare in Sweden is <strong>absolutely atrocious and also completely incredible</strong>. On the one side, for most health issues you will be met with different medical doctors each appointment, most of them only having a few stressful minutes to half-listen before sending you on your way without too much hassle and effort. Meeting human to human, trusting expertise, being listened to, finding help for mental health issues, being taken seriously, all of this is a rarity in healthcare. However, prove that your condition is serious enough and nurses, doctors, surgeons, therapists, priests, and, I&#39;m sure, the prime minister, suddenly spawn out of nowhere and you&#39;re sent through a mechanistic wonder of expertise, reason, intuition, skill, efficiency, medical substances, all in order for you to come out the other side healthy and alive, barely paying a dime for it. There is something to this. Is it modernity excelling at treating sickness while being almost incapacitated with regards to health and a good life? Also, what roles do medications, something medical corporations profit from, play in the maintaining but not curing of a population? There is something to this. We have somehow gotten healthcare very wrong while getting parts of it very right. Why? Also, the way we tackle curing cancers never seems to include a conversation about halting the release of anthropogenic carcinogens? Why? Can we get healthcare right if we get everything else wrong?</p>
