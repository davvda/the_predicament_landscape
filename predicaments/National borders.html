			<h2>National borders</h2>
			<p>Do not mistake the map for the territory. Unless you&#39;re dealing with national borders. <strong>National borders are geographical boundaries that separate governments, states, nations, and peoples</strong>. Some are heavily guarded and some are completely unguarded. Some are natural borders consisting of mountains, rivers, oceans, or other landscape features, and some borders are political and largely arbitrary.</p>
