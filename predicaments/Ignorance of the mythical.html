			<h2>Ignorance of the mythical</h2>
			<p><strong>A myth is a narrative that plays a fundamental role in a culture</strong>. The ongoing narrative is largely based on the myth of the ascent of humanity, the narrative of progress and separation. It is generally not talked about that myths control much of the underlying dynamics of our civilisation. Myths are often fictions told as vaguely historical stories that explain how, why, and what the world is, has become, and/or will end. Forget our fundamental myths and you might just confuse them with reality.</p>
