			<h2>Ecological crisis</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Once you learn to read the land, I have no fear of what you will do to it, or with it. And I know many pleasant things it will do to you.

			<p>Ecology is the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ecology">study of our dwelling place</a>, more specifically a field of science studying the interconnected systems of Earth. </p>
<p><strong>The ecological crisis is a destabilisation or breakdown of these systems large enough to threaten humanity&#39;s continued survival</strong>. It is, however, important to include other organisms in this since the ongoing man-made ecological crises are causing the extinction of multiple species every day. From a systems-thinking perspective every species going extinct reduces an ecosystem&#39;s options to restabilise after a destabilising event. It is therefore not unlikely that we end up snowballing the effects of climate change by reducing the resilience and complexity of ecosystems past the point where a recovery is possible.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="../Fear.html">Fear</a></strong> - Ecological collapse incites fear. It should. We mustn't become paralysed by this fear. If your house is on fire you must get the ones you love to safety and extinguish the flames. The response required is beyond fight, flight, or freeze.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Genocide.html">Genocide</a></strong> - People are dying as a result of our ecological crisis. At the same time, we are mostly aware of what actions directly create ecological crises. Awareness of the direct actions we're taking that leads to people dying. Yeah, that's something akin to genocide. Anthropocide?</li>

One does wonder if anything would change if business and world leaders were forced to live where the collapse was most evident. Then again, most of them currently live in the company of each other on the golf court and I might rather dry into a prune in the desert than play golf with old white men with prunish tans.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Lack of resilient systems.html">Lack of resilient systems</a></strong> - The complexity of certain ecosystems show a resilience beyond any anthropogenic systems. What took a long time to form, however, is now collapsing rapidly. The more of these systems we lose, the less resilience the global systems have.</li>
