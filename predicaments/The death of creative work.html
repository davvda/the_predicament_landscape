<h2>The death of creative work</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing shit about new snow<br>
for the rich<br>
is not art.</p>
<cite>Kobayashi Issa</cite>
</blockquote><p>Corporations are sociopathic cybernetic entities that have the goal to grow by earning profits. Being employed by a corporation means that your purpose is to help the corporation create more profit than the worth of your salary. I'm afraid that's it. <strong>Creative work will then need to work similarly to a faucet or an industrial assembly process</strong>. The nature of most creative employment therefore erodes the source of true creativity and, if any creativity remains, that creativity will be used as fairy dust for maximising profit. Or advertising. Due to the mechanistic and procedural process of modern creative work combined with the naturally intermittent bursts of human creativity, we see this field being one of the first fields to be replaced by artificial intelligence algorithms. </p><blockquote>
<p>The craftsman who made the rose window at Chartres<br>
rose one morning in the dead of winter,<br>
shivered into what layers of wool he owned,<br>
and went to his bench to boil molten lead.<br>
This was not the day to cut the glass or dye it,<br>
lift it to the sun to see the colors dance<br>
along the walls, or catch one's breath<br>
at peacock shades of blue: only, today,<br>
to lay hot lead in careful lines, circles,<br>
wiping and trimming, making<br>
a perfect space for light.</p>
<p>When Wren designed St. Paul’s, he had to turn away<br>
each day from the vision in his mind's wide eye<br>
to scraps of paper where columns of figures measured<br>
tension and stress, heft and curve, angle and bearing point.<br>
Whole days he spent considering the density<br>
of granite, the weathering of hardwoods,<br>
the thickness of perfect mortar; all<br>
to the greater glory of God.</p>
<p>And Vermeer with his houseful of children<br>
didn't paint some days, didn't even mix<br>
powders or stretch canvasses, or clean palettes,<br>
but hauled in firewood, cleaned out<br>
a flue, repaired a broken cradle, remembering,<br>
as he bent to his task, how light shone gold<br>
on a woman’s flesh, and gathered<br>
in drops on her pearls.</p>
