<h2>Greed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>So the unwanting soul<br>
sees what's hidden,<br>
and the ever-wanting soul<br>
sees only what it wants.</p>
<cite>Lao Tzu</cite>
</blockquote><p>Greed is complicated. It's often defined as the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/greed" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/greed" target="_blank">excessively eager desire to possess</a>and is commonly talked about as one of the drivers of capitalism, the basic fundament of human nature. I would argue that <strong>greed is a response to fear of scarcity</strong>, either in the present moment or projected into the future. Capitalism rewards accumulation, drives fear of scarcity, and generates and maintains greed. </p><blockquote>
<p>Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.</p>
<cite>Warren Buffett</cite>
