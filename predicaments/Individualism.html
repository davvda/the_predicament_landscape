<h2>Individualism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Birds born in cages think that flying is a disease.</p>
<cite>Alejandro Jodorowsky</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Individualism emphasises the intrinsic worth of the individual</strong>, that is, the singular person. Individualism has become a predicament more because of the things it doesn't do rather than the things it does. Its focus on individual goal-achieving, self-reliance, and independence only become an issue when taken to extremes in opposition to collective welfare, community, interdependence, and broader awareness of ones belonging and contributions. </p><p><strong>Connections:</strong></p><ul>
