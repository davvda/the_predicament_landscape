<h2>Lack of masculine and feminine</h2>
<p><strong>The modern world lacks paths of initiation into woman- and manhood</strong>. Putting any questions of binary gender and sex aside, there are clear difficulties in finding ones role in societies where positive feminine and masculine archetypes are missing. Masculinity is often preceded by &quot;toxic&quot; and femininity, despite progress in gender equality overall, is often seen as weak. </p>

Woman- and manhood are complementary, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang" target="_blank">not opposing</a>, forces. It is only in the joining of dualities that new wholeness, new life, is created.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
