			<h2>Directionlessness</h2>
			<p>It seems to me that, in modern society, on the scale of individuals to all of humanity, <strong>we have solved the problem of direction by striving to move with higher speed</strong>. Going faster and having more will surely yield progress, inexorably lead to everything being better. If you are uncertain, perhaps rightfully so, as to where you should be going it is unwise to tackle this by simply going faster. On the contrary, the less certain you are the slower you should move, instead focusing on getting to grips with your present surroundings. Even if speed, magnitude, accumulation, growth, and restlessness got you to where you are now there are times where you must cease the unceasing motion and consider where you&#39;re headed, where your direction should be. If nothing else, stop, find a high point and see what&#39;s on the horizon.</p>
