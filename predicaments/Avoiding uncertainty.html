<h2>Avoiding uncertainty</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not view mountains from the scale of human thought.</p>
<cite>Dogen Zenji</cite>
</blockquote><p>Sometimes we lack simple solutions, adequate answers, and obvious paths forward. This can be tremendously uncomfortable but <strong>it is crucial to stay with the questions and uncertainty in order to find the right path</strong>. We are bad at this. Mostly, we avoid uncertainty at all cost, instead convincing ourselves and others of the certainty of wrong answers and non-solutions. There are no easy answers to the predicaments we face, nor should there be, since we haven't yet managed to find the right questions.</p><blockquote>
<p>The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next.</p>
<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin</cite>
