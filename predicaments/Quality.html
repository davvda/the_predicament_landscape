<h2>Quality</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To seek the timeless way we must first know the quality without a name. There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.</p>
<cite>Christopher Alexander</cite>
</blockquote><p>Quality is a property of something. The pragmatic interpretation is the superiority of something. I believe quality is more or less undefinable and is, rather, something felt. I also believe quality as a noun is problematic since an object shows its superior quality through a mode of being or through an aspect of its existence. <strong>Things of quality tend to last longer, last differently, feel full of intention, exist more purely</strong>. Quality is usually talked about in opposition to quantity and is, in general, seen as the opposing dial in a production process. Increase the quantity and you must decrease the quality and vice versa. Because of quality's undefinable quality and our modern time's obsession with measuring and quantification, quality has in many cases been pushed to the sidelines. If we cannot measure it we cannot understand it, we might claim. Yet, I believe we most likely have a superior intuition about quality than we do about quantity. Never mind how many jelly beans the jar contains, would you say the jar is of a good quality?</p><p>Quality is also related to the virtues of the divine and therefore tends to be kept in the realms of the religious. With religion and spirituality having a miniscule part in modern life there are few reasons to seek the improvement of one's qualities.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
