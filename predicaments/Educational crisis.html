<h2>Educational crisis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the essential, the what is; and to awaken this capacity, in oneself and in others, is education.</p>
<cite>J. Krishnamurti</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" class="external-link" href="../https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" target="_blank">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills and traits</a></strong> and means <em>to bring forth</em>. A crisis of education is therefore the potential or actual failure of this transmission and the failure to bring forth humans with the knowledge, skills, and traits needed to find their way in the world. Informal education's role has decreased while the increased role of formal education has narrowed to the point where much necessary knowledge and understanding requires an unlearning of one's formal education. Education, both formal and informal, is necessary for the prevailing of cultures but its current effects aren't just decreasingly constructive, they're also increasingly destructive.</p><blockquote>
<p>Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence.</p>
<cite>Maria Montessori</cite>
