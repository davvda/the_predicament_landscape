			<h2>The Dark Triad</h2>
			<p><strong>The Dark Triad of human psychology consists of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy</strong>. Briefly explained, the focus on oneself, the ability to play others as pieces on a chess board, and impaired empathy and remorse combined with charm. Exhibit all traits of the dark triad and you&#39;ll most likely be well off in our modern civilisation. Do tell me about your latest raise. </p>
