<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Art is about <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/kunnan%C4%85">knowledge</a>, <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/art">skill, craft, ability, preparation, and a mode of existence</a>. <strong>Art is the creative expression of culture and life</strong>. Art attempts to capture and communicate the unspeakable. Art is the highest level of skill and any skill or act can become art. How and why has art become a predicament? Mainly, but not entirely, due to commodification. In order to live as an artist one needs knowledge of market forces, skills in marketing, efficiency over craft, ability to constrain creativity, prepare to work in advertisement, and reject the mode of existence that art demands. If art dies, culture dies. Luckily, art historically seems to be the one immortal cultural resistance. Art, however, needs to remain free to expand. </p>
