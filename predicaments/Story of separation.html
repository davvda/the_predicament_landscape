<h2>Story of separation</h2>
<p>I was introduced to the story of separation through the work of Charles Eisenstein. In <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/eng/separation/">his words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who are you? You are a separate individual among other separate individuals in a universe that is separate from you as well. You are a Cartesian mote of consciousness looking out through the eyes of a flesh robot, programmed by its genes to maximize reproductive self-interest. You are a bubble of psychology, a mind (whether brain-based or not) separate from other minds and separate from matter. Or you are a soul encased in flesh, separate from the world and separate from other souls. Or you are a mass, a conglomeration of particles operating according to the impersonal forces of physics.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Who are we as a people? We are a special kind of animal, the apex of evolution, possessing brains that allow the cultural as well as the genetic transfer of information. We are unique in having (in the religious view) a soul or (in the scientific view) a rational mind. In our mechanical universe we alone possess consciousness and the wherewithal to mold the world according to our design. The only limit to our ability to do so is that amount of force we can harness and the precision with which we can apply it. The more we are able to do so, the better off we are in this indifferent or hostile universe, the more comfortable and secure.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Where have we come from and where are we going? We started out as naked, ignorant animals, barely hanging on to survival, living lives that were nasty, brutish, and short. Fortunately, thanks to our big brains, science replaced superstition and technology replaced ritual. We ascended to become the lords and possessors of nature, domesticating plants and animals, harnessing natural forces, conquering diseases, laying bare the deepest secrets of the universe. Our destiny is to complete that conquest: to free ourselves from labor, from disease, from death itself, to ascend to the stars and leave nature behind altogether.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...The answers to these questions are culturally dependent, yet they immerse us so completely that we have seen them as reality itself. These answers are changing today, along with everything built atop them—which basically means our entire civilization. That is why we sometimes get the vertiginous feeling that the whole world is falling apart. Seeing the emptiness of what once seemed so real, practical, and enduring, we stand as if at an abyss. What’s next? Who am I? What’s important? What is the purpose of my life? How can I be an effective agent of healing? The old answers are fading as the Story of the People that once answered them crumbles around us.</p>
</blockquote><p>In short then, the story of separation is, or was(?), the dominating narrative of humanity. You are separate from other humans, humans are separate from other animals, <strong>the world consists of separate things</strong>, we must continue along the axis of progress and mould these separate things for the continued domination of and further separation from the primitiveness of lesser beings. Separation might be the most fundamental aspect of our modern world view and, despite its lack of lived experiential evidence, holds on firmly in the process of unlearning.</p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
