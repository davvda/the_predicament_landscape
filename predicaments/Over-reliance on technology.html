			<h2>Over-reliance on technology</h2>
			<p>Civilisation stands upon a foundation of technologies, but we must be wary of mistaking the technological foundation for the ground, especially when the technology is developed and managed by, as is often the case, corporations or profit-seeking entities. The technological foundations of our civilisation contain many technologies that are bound together with other predicaments in this landscape leading to a lack of resilience, increasing the risk for societal collapse in a globally affecting event. This is especially the case with technologies used for basic needs such as heating, food production, water and sewage treatment, and electricity. <strong>Small disruptions to non-resilient technological systems can rapidly lead to chaos</strong>.</p>
