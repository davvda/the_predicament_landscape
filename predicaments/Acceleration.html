<title>Acceleration</title>
<h2>Acceleration</h2>
<p><strong>Acceleration means an increase in velocity</strong>. Many things that rapidly approach a multifaceted collapse are constantly accelerating, seemingly unmoved by attempts to halt them. There are many reasons for the acceleration and, to name one, economic growth doesn't just result in acceleration, it demands it for its continuance. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are flooring it.<br>
The soles of our Converse<br>
worn down to bare feet,<br>
the heat of the pedal searing the skin.<br>
We are underage,<br>
under the influence,<br>
Wunderbaum's scent<br>
replaced with burnt rubber.<br>
We no longer know where we're headed<br>
but we think we've caught up<br>
with the horizon,<br>
high above the clouds.<br>
The infant in the backseat is still asleep.<br>
<em>As long as we're going faster,</em><br>
we tell ourselves<br>
with tears or sweat or it doesn't matter<br>
running down our face,<br>
<em>we'll get there.</em></p>

Actors are accelerating development to be the first to arrive at certain exponential technologies and those technologies will then contribute with additional multipliers to our acceleration.</li>
