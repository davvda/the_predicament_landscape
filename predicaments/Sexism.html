			<h2>Sexism</h2>
			<p><strong>Sexism is the discrimination of someone based on their sex or gender</strong>. Sexism comes in many forms, some of which are accepted and barely recognised and some of which are seen as clearly wrong in every aspect. Both the milder and the stronger forms of sexism have their origins in deeply conditioned beliefs that put clear valence on male versus female attributes and characteristics. </p>
