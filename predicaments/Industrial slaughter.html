<h2>Industrial slaughter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We are <em>definitely different</em> from the bad people in history. The immoral fools tricked by Hitler into saluting the iron cross and casting their votes in favour of genocide, the spiritually corrupt slave traders of the colonies in Africa, the Europeans pillaging and raping (culturally and literally) the indigenous people of the "new worlds" of America, Australia, etc; the brilliant geniuses talked into developing the atom bomb, the monsters who then dropped those bombs over Japan in the name of peace. We are definitely different from them. <em>The most efficient systematic slaughter of sentient beings the planet has ever seen</em>, the complete indifference to the ecocide required for our day-to-day lives, the endless belief in infinite growth on a finite planet, the quantification of all that is sacred into mere resources and business opportunities, the utter carelessness toward the world our children will inherit. All this we manage to stand for in the name of progress and human kind's superiority over all others. No, we are <em>definitely different</em>. We are worse.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Industrial slaughter is the efficient industrialised process of killing other beings</strong>. Rarely can the slaughterhouses of modernity be heard, hidden away in fields far from people, but, if you listen, you can hear them.</p><p><strong>Connections:</strong></p><ul>
