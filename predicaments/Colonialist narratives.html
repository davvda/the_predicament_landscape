<h2>Colonialist narratives</h2>
<p>Today we don&#39;t bring god to other countries, we bring the global capitalist economic system. Or do we?</p>
<p>Colonialism is defined as the practice by which powerful countries control less powerful countries in order to increase their own power and wealth. Colonialism is often talked about as something historical, a mistake in the past, imperialist cruelty, but the modern world is packed to the brim with colonialist narratives and actions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colonies are the outhouses of the European soul, where a fellow can let his pants down and relax, enjoy the smell of his own shit. [...] Out and down in the colonies, life can be indulged, life and sensuality in all its forms, with no harm done to the Metropolis, nothing to soil those cathedrals, white marble statues, noble thoughts... No word ever gets back. The silences down here are vast enough to absorb all behavior, no matter how dirty, how animal it gets...</p>
<cite>Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>The real essence of colonialism is the forcing onto other peoples and places of the idea of separate things with impermeable boundaries, the story of separation.</strong></p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
