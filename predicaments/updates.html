<h3>2024-09-25 Rain & Evil</h3>
<p>The autumn equinox has been followed by days of darkness, pouring rain, and, consequently, calmness and coffee indoors. Many thoughts regarding balance and equilibrium have moved around in my mind lately. Anyways... I will be starting the process of illustrating and expanding the predicaments in the category currently named Metacrisis of Evil. The following predicaments are included in this category/continent:</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="../War.html">War</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Evil.html">Evil</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Genocide.html">Genocide</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Industrial slaughter.html">Industrial slaughter</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Mistreatment of animals.html">Mistreatment of animals</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Mistreatment of other humans.html">Mistreatment of other humans</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Modern slavery.html">Modern slavery</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Moloch.html">Moloch</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Nuclear war.html">Nuclear war</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims.html">Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you have any suggestions, ideas, complaints, or just want to get in touch, I happily discuss this with anyone who is interested. Just shoot me an email at david@punk.ist.</p>
<h3>2024-09-23 Autumn Equinox & Ecological Metacrisis </h3>
<p>There is now an illustration up on the start page and the predicaments in the ecological metacrisis are properly filled out. Onward!</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="../Biodiversity loss.html">Biodiversity loss</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Climate change.html">Climate change</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Deforestation.html">Deforestation</a></li>

        <li><a href="../Soil erosion.html">Soil erosion</a></li>
        <li><a href="../Waste.html">Waste</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>2024-09-10</h3>
<p>Have added link motivations to some of the predicaments in the Ecological Metacrisis part of the landscape. Have almost finished illustrating that part of the map as well, just have to digitise it and figure out how to make it clickable and functional.</p>
<h3>2024-08-26</h3>
<p>Drawing has started and I'm currently sketching out predicaments with pencil and ink. Fun!</p>
<h3>2024-08-22</h3>
<p>Write link motivations for Climate Change and start drawing/illustrating the map for the part of the landscape named Ecological Metacrisis which contains: Climate change, Biodiversity loss, Desertification, Deforestation, Ecological crisis, Extreme weather, Lost of insect biomass, Microplastics, Soil erosion, Ocean acidification, Pollution, and Waste. Drawing will take a long time.</p>
<h3>2024-08-19</h3>
<p>Big update fixing links and a bunch of other crap.</p>
<h3>2024-08-16</h3>
<p>Bulk edit all (most?) predicaments.</p>
<h3>2024-08-14</h3>
<p>Fixed the styling for predicaments 1-10 and added this Updates page.</p>
<h3>2024-08-13</h3>
<p>Converted all Markdown to HTML and published the first beta version here.</p>
<h3>2024...</h3>
<p>Create the predicament landscape, write all predicaments, begin connecting them, enjoy living.</p>
