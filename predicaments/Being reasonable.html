<h2>Being reasonable</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many different kinds of stupidity, and cleverness is one of the worst.</p>
<cite>Thomas Mann</cite>

<p><strong>To be reasonable is, or rather should be, to think through and to understand</strong>. Most features of our predicament landscape have arisen due to our commitment to (try to) be reasonable. Unreasonably reasonable.  To stop deforestation is not seen as reasonable, to <a href="https://theconversation.com/sweden-has-vast-old-growth-forests-but-they-are-being-chopped-down-faster-than-the-amazon-218753">cut down most of the old growth forests</a> apparently is. Reasoning has its merits but it seems we must dare to be a bit unreasonable to be able to manage our modern predicaments. All reasoning tends to follow a certain optimisation and prioritisation and if we haven&#39;t figured out what to optimise for (meta-optimisation) our reasoning has little value.</p>
