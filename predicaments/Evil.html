<h2>Evil</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.</p>
<cite>Gautama Buddha</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Evil is the exponential externalisation of internal suffering</strong>. It is an unleashing of inner demons into the world, their power multiplied by hatred, revenge, destruction, death, pain, apathy, and war. Every person must overcome their own evils.</p><p><strong>Connections:</strong></p><ul>
