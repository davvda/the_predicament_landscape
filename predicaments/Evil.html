<h2>Evil</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.</p>
<cite>Gautama Buddha</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Evil is the exponential externalisation of internal suffering</strong>. It is an unleashing of inner demons into the world, their power multiplied by hatred, revenge, destruction, death, pain, apathy, and war. Every person must overcome their own evils.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="../Immoral justifications.html">Immoral justifications</a></strong> - There are sometimes discussions about evil existing at all. This is understandable when our vision is obscured by all of these complicated justifications for everything.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Industrial slaughter.html">Industrial slaughter</a></strong> - The industry of slaughter is, I think, without a single doubt, going to be regarded as the most evil act ever done on Earth in all its history by any being. It is a system so far beyond morality and goodness that it's nearly unspeakable. Perhaps that is why we mostly hide it.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Lack of cultural control systems.html">Lack of cultural control systems</a></strong> - Many cultures have had clear control systems for managing and hindering acts of evil and instead cultivating balance and harmony. We are not part such a culture. Our culture(s) rewards evil as long as it is indirect and untraceable.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Lack of faith in anything.html">Lack of faith in anything</a></strong> - Humans can be many things. Evil is one of them. When humans seem inherently to harbour so many demons, what hope and faith can there be?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Multipolar traps.html">Multipolar traps</a></strong> - Evil combined with multipolar traps generate races to the bottom of everything. The corpses laying within the multipolar traps of history often wear their evil grins until they're nothing but bones.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Nihilism.html">Nihilism</a></strong> - Evil needs nihilism. To nihilists, there is no such thing as evil so why should it matter what evil one spreads?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Nuclear war.html">Nuclear war</a></strong> - One of the most extreme exponential acts of evil is the detonation of atom bombs.</li>
