<p>Passion creates, addiction consumes.</p>

</blockquote><p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction">Addictions are disorders characterised by a persistent and intense urge to use a substance and/or engage in a behaviour that produces natural reward, despite whatever negative consequences it may have</a></strong>. Everyone who reads this will be addicted to something, and I'm not saying that particularly lightly. Craving without self-control is the bread and butter of capitalism. Alcohol and the "typical" drugs, but also food, sugar, shopping, gambling, porn, sex, social media, games, medications, entertainment, TV, work, thought, spiritual, pain, money, exercise, etc. Addiction is the ideal driver of stable, predictable, and sustained consumption and behaviour and, furthermore, <strong>an addicted population will exhibit an intrinsic control system towards a life that is in balance with their addiction</strong>, rarely deviating too far in any direction. It must surely be rare that heroin addicts protest against the manufacturing of heroin?</p><p dir="auto">Connections:</p><ul>
