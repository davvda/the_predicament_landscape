<h2>Parenting</h2>
<p>Parenting, especially good parenting, has, in many ways, never been as difficult as it is today. It takes a village to raise a child, it is said, and withstanding the lack of village-sized communities, parents barely have the time or energy to raise their children. It seems that in order to be a good parent, whatever that might mean, one must choose to fail in the areas modern society values most such as individual goals and achievements, freedom of time, career success, productivity, financial wealth, social status, etc. To be a stay-at-home parent seems to mean one has chosen individualist suicide in service of others, oh the shame. </p>
<p>If you disagree with everything written in this predicament landscape, can you at least recognise that the way society discourages the proper caring of children (just look at the salary of kindergarten teachers) is plainly, utterly, completely, terrifyingly stupid? And <strong>if society justifies fucking up the raising of new humans, what the fuck do we think will happen?</strong></p>
