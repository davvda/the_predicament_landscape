			<h2>Ignorance of ongoing collapse</h2>
			<p>Imagine, for a moment, that we suddenly were able to manage all of the predicaments in the landscape, that we somehow solved all of our problems and helped the Earth recover. The time preceding this moment will, I believe, be seen as one of the most catastrophic collapses of life the Earth has ever seen. In just a few hundred years the Earth has gone from a beautiful, wild, and diverse place to a planet where more than 95% of mammals are cattle bred for food, pets bred for obedience, and humans pushed to compliance. The Earth is, of course, still beautiful and diverse, and has some wildness left. My argument is simply that so much has already collapsed and is already collapsing, <strong>the collapse is not some future event</strong>. The same goes for the economy, the climate, ecosystems, social welfare, spirituality, and life force in general. It is already happening, how do we control the descent, save what can be saved, and work on recovering and cultivating, fermenting, something better in the ruins?</p>
