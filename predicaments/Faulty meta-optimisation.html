<h2>Faulty meta-optimisation</h2>	
<p><strong>Meta-optimisation is optimising what you&#39;re optimising</strong>. In simpler terms, it is prioritisation. Every action we take can be seen as contributing to one long optimisation equation, consciously or not. There are times when what you optimise for is obvious, perhaps buying a car that maximises convenience while minimising cost. Most times, however, what you&#39;re optimising for is complicated and multi-faceted. Furthermore, many systems incentivise us to optimise badly. This is where meta-optimisation comes in. How do you make sure that if you want to optimise for a &quot;life well lived&quot;, you have (meta)optimised your optimisation equation to actually yield that result? Now, this is an unanswerable question or, rather, it is a question you can spend several lives trying to answer, but while the perfect optimisation doesn&#39;t exist and constantly changes it is quite clear when an optimisation equation hasn&#39;t been correctly (meta)optimised. When this fact appears in stark relief, something has to change. When variables such as wealth keep increasing while variables such as time spent in old-growth forests (apologies to any hippiephobe), enjoyment of music, or pure joy have stopped increasing and may even be decreasing we have to re-meta-optimise.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is of course also the question of meta-meta-optimisation and meta-meta-meta-optimisation but that becomes a bit too meta at this time, even for me.</p>
