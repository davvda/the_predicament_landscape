<h2>Lack of agency</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How wonderful it is that nobody needs to wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.</p>
<cite>Anne Frank</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Agency is the capacity to act</strong>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency" class="external-link" href="../https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency" target="_blank">to effectively set in motion, powerfully incite action</a>.

It is, in other words, independent from the direct context and events of your situation. You can always increase your agency in some way, find how and where you're capable of action.</p><blockquote>
<p>The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.</p>
<cite>Simon Sarris</cite>
</blockquote><p>If nothing else, learning to accept situations where you experience a lack agency can lead to an internal agency of thought that suddenly changes everything. There are no moments that completely lack agency, you just have to notice it. </p><p>Connetions:</p><ul>
