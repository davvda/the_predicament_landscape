			<h2>Traffic noise</h2>
			<p>We can close our eyes or avert our gaze but our ears stay constantly receptive and open. <strong>Traffic noise is, simply, any sound created by traffic</strong>. Roadway noise created primarily by tires <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/traffic">rubbing across</a> the roadway surface is the most prevalent form of environmental noise and there are few places in the modern world where this noise hasn&#39;t spread. Engines, transmissions, air resistance, braking, and any friction also contribute to traffic noise as well as horns and sirens.</p>
