<h2>Nihilism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Those are my enemies: they want to overthrow and to construct nothing themselves. They say: "All that is worthless"--and want to create no value themselves.</p>
<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" target="_blank">Nihilism is a set of philosophical views that rejects certain aspects of human existence, such as knowledge, morality, or meaning</a></strong>. Life is meaningless, there is nothing such as knowledge and wisdom, everything is pointless, worthless, and without value. Nihilism, etymologically, simply means nothingness. There is, therefore, nothing behind, within, or underneath it all. The world, existence, consciousness, the soul, all is one big nothingness. In some ways I can agree with nihilists that underneath all of everything there is no-thingness. There is something else. Nihilists believe in nothing and have nothing to lose, see nothing in values, ethics, or the continued existence of the world, or even that their actions have any effect on anything that matters. </p><blockquote>
<p>The man of the future who will redeem us not only from the hitherto reigning ideal but also from that which was bound to grow out of it, the great nausea, the will to nothingness, nihilism; this bell stroke of noon and of the great decision that liberates the will again and restores its goal to the earth and his hope to man; this Antichrist and anti-nihilist; this victor over God and nothingness - he must come one day.</p>
<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>
