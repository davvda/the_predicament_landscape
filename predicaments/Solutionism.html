<h2>Solutionism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem.</p>
<cite>Joseph Stalin</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Solutionism generally views all problems as engineering or technology problems</strong>, that all problems can be solved through a technological fix. The problems solutionism tends to solve are generally caused by the technological fixes that were used to solve the previous problem. With solutionism's basis being the reductionistic and mechanistic view of the world, what tends to happen is that each solution brings unforeseen externalities that require further solving. The way solutionism expresses itself today, often as a "kicking the bucket" situation, is one of the main reasons why I've decided on discussing predicaments rather than problems. There will be no solutions or technological fixes for this landscape.</p><p><strong>Connections:</strong></p><ul>
