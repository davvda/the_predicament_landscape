<h2>Bureaucracy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the machine for control is to be controlled by the machine.</p>
<cite>James Carse</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy" target="_blank">Bureaucracy is a system of organisation where decisions are made by non-elected officials</a></strong> and is modern civilisation's main administrative system governing any institution. Characterised by hierarchy, continuity, impersonality, and specialised expertise it is the perfect opposite of what our predicament landscape needs. Hierarchy will ensure that the impersonal top level bureaucrats continue gaining from their expertise no matter the external effects. Bureaucracy is a highly centralised form of management and therefore hinders opportunities for emergence and decentralised responses to societal disruptions. Centralisation is not necessarily bad but it reduces a society's ability to respond in a sufficiently complex manner to complex situations. </p><p>It is not improbable that while modern civilisation collapses under its own weight, the rulers will trudge through the warm rusted desert sand of our attics, clutching their hairless chests, carrying their desks on their backs, shuffling their feet to the ticking of the typewriters.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
