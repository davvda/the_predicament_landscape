<h2>Sense-making crisis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is quite usual for us to gather pieces of information from various sources, thinking in this way to increase our knowledge. Actually, following this way we end up not knowing anything at all... Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.</p>
<cite>Shunryu Suzuki</cite>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>The real existential risk is a loss of the ability to make sense of the world around us: what is worth doing, and what the likely effects of things will be.</p>
<cite>Daniel Schmachtenberger</cite>
</blockquote><p>In the words of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/" class="external-link" href="https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank">The Consilience Project</a>, </p><blockquote>
<p>Changes in science, media, and the nature of our basic social structures (such as economics, politics, and warfare) have been building in complexity at an accelerating rate. Our ability to make sense of things can no longer keep pace. This is a situation in which effective innovations are needed that can upgrade our capacities for learning, fast. We have little choice but to learn new ways to make sense of the world together, in a new kind of public sphere. This new approach to sensemaking is needed to address an increasing number of consequential decisions facing our governments, communities, and families. </p>
<p>...Without a shared ability to make sense of the world as a means to inform our choices, we are left with only the game of power.</p>
</blockquote><p>What, then, is sense-making? It is, I believe, significant that the etymological roots of the word <em>sense</em> are <em>way</em> and <em>journey</em>. The predicament landscape is one way of trying to manage the sense-making crisis and, figuratively, it's attempting to do this by finding ways and paths in the predicament landscape and, consequently, hopefully, ways forward for us and our world. <strong>Sense-making, in other words, is creating a viable way in and through the complex nature of existence</strong> with our present predicaments.</p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
