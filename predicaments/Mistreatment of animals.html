<h2>Mistreatment of animals</h2>
<p>It is not unreasonable to make the case that <strong>there has never in the history of the Earth existed a more prolonged and systematic creation of suffering than the current mistreatment of animals</strong>, specifically animals used in the production of food. Those humans who manage to climb out of the collapsed rubble of modernity will surely see our mistreatment of animals as the biggest moral crime in all of history, the most terrible nightmare, the darkest and most evil of industrial demons, the thorn in the belief in the good of their own species. </p>
<p>About a million cows are slaughtered every day, around 3 million goats and sheep, close to 4 million pigs, 12 million ducks, and hundreds of millions of fish. 140,000 chickens are slaughtered each minute. If you believe animals suffer at all, even just the tiniest amount, the moral scale of these actions is immense beyond imagining. </p>
<p>I can sometimes find certain justifications believable, especially when actions have very complex impacts that aren&#39;t directly obvious. Any justification for the efficient incessant holocaust machinery that our meat consumption requires is simply ridiculous. </p>
<p>We shouldn&#39;t, of course, forget the impact humans have on wild animals or, maybe it would be more accurate to say the impact it has had on wild animals, since there are very few left. Since the rise of humans around a hundred thousand years ago there has been an 85% decline in terrestrial wild mammal biomass and we can now quite confidently claim that we are living through an anthropogenic extinction event. 4% of the Earth&#39;s mammals are wild and we&#39;re working on getting them extinct, 34% percent are humans, the remaining 62% are our pets or live short lives in factories of death. One shouldn&#39;t get caught up in numbers but I think that says enough.</p>
