			<h2>Simplifications</h2>
			<p>How do we make sense of the world? We generally do it through developing <strong>models that act as simplifications of the world</strong>. This is necessary and useful. It is not unlikely that this model-making and ability for recursive abstraction is what makes the human mind different from other minds. The simplified models allow us to form an understanding of how an animal functions and moves while recursive abstraction allows us to go from the understanding that biting can penetrate the animal&#39;s skin to an insight into teeth, force, sharpness, and furthermore the development of the bow and arrow. </p>
			<p>The problem arises when we start overrelying on simplifications and models to the extent that we fail to make sense of the complexity of the world. It is sometimes said that if you can&#39;t explain something simply you do not understand it. I would counter that with perhaps the controversial view that <em>if you truly and deeply understand something you might not be able to explain it at all</em>. </p>
			<p>The world and everything in it is infinitely complex and simplifications serve as good models. However, when we accept these simplifications as accurate depictions of the world we lose our ability to act when the world acts in ways the models didn&#39;t predict. If we keep our simplified world view the risk is that the world starts <a href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/about">simplifying us</a>.</p>
