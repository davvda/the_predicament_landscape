			<h2>Blaming the people</h2>
			<p>The system of the free market claims to simply give people what they need and want. If what the people claim to need and want is good for them or not is beyond the market to decide. This rationale leads to the common viewpoint of <strong>blaming the people or the individual for whatever effects their actions have on themselves, others, and the planet</strong>. According to this viewpoint it is up to each individual to act morally and correctly for their own and others well-being and, when they fail to do so, take the sole responsibility for their failures. Blaming the people for their behaviour in systems that condition and control them tends to go hand in hand with behaviour that is much more morally corrupt than the behaviour being blamed. Humans are one of the most adaptable animals on Earth and will adapt to whatever systems and conditions they&#39;re in. Don&#39;t kill people, kill their systems.</p>
