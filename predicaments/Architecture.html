			<h2>Architecture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The specific patterns, out of which a building or a town is made<br>
may be alive or dead. To the extent they are alive, they let our inner<br>
forces loose, and, set us free; but when they are dead they keep<br>
us locked in inner conflict.</p>
<cite>Christopher Alexander</cite>
</ul>
</blockquote><p><strong>Architecture is the art and technique of designing human constructions.</strong> It is a field which reaches far into the realms of the practical, pragmatic, and utilitarian, while simultaneously reaching into the depths of aesthetics, beauty, and nature. It is also a field whose reach in one direction is easily measured while the other direction isn't. The forces of modernity will then have its way with architecture and this, among other things, is what has lead modern architecture to become what it currently is. Quoting Encyclopedia Britannica's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture" class="external-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture" target="_blank">article</a> on architecture, you cannot separate the two reaches of architecture, "because every society—settled or nomadic—has a spatial relationship to the natural world and to other societies, the structures they produce reveal much about their environment (including climate and weather), history, ceremonies, and artistic sensibility, as well as many aspects of daily life".</p><blockquote>
<p>The world of utility and the world of beauty are not separate realms.</p>
