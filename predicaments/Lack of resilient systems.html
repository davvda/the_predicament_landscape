<h2>Lack of resilient systems</h2>
<p><strong>Resilient systems have the ability to <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/resilience">leap back</a> into equilibrium and adapt</strong> to changing conditions.</p>
<p>When systems are designed to be rigid, static, simple, and centralised they tend to lack resilience and instead collapse in a destabilising event. Many of our civilisation&#39;s systems are so interdependent that any destabilising event can create detrimental cascade effects that affect everyone. If we take the chance to redesign our systems we need to design more resilient systems that can adapt to novel situations, stay functional despite major disruptions, and allow for emergent and complex responses. </p>

<p>Let's face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and chaotic. It is dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, not uniformity. That's what makes the world interesting, that's what makes it beautiful, and that's what makes it work.</p>
<cite>Donella Meadows</cite>
</blockquote><p>Importantly, we must also make sure that we do not become, or keep being, the disruption that ruins existing resilient systems. There are few systems resilient to the destructive capabilities of our civilisation but it is crucial that those that still exist, such as the Amazon or the atmosphere, are kept alive. </p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
