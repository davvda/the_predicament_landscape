			<h2>Meat eating</h2>
			<p>Whether or not one&#39;s diet should include meat is, in this case, better discussed elsewhere, though it should, in this landscape, be quite obvious where the arrows point. Nonetheless, meat consumption as an ethical, environmental, and health-related predicament is, I believe, quite clear. Ethics aside, speaking the language of modernity <strong>meat consumption is so ludicrously inefficient</strong> when it comes to land use. We require a tremendous amount of land to raise livestock and the caloric extraction is increasingly more inefficient the further away from the main source we go. There is an argument to be made for nutrient density of meat but it still pales in comparison with the lack of efficiency, logic, and just common sense that our current solutions are evidence of. It is estimated that it takes around 100 times as much land to produce a kilocalorie of beef versus plant-based alternatives and, before you speak, the same is true for a gram of protein. Is modernity really obsessed with efficiency and intelligent solutions?</p>
