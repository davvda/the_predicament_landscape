			<h2>Dealing with death</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, only in dying life: bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.</p>
				<cite>Ursula K. Le Guin, A Wizard of Earthsea</cite>
				</blockquote>
			<p>Most cultures of modernity deal terribly with death. Maybe it is a part of reality that makes the artificial nature of our lives too clear for us. <strong>Death is a necessary part of life and the way we deal with death will reflect on how we deal with life</strong>. Once again, we have trouble with the broader view, complexity, infinity, and eternity. Do not put death under a cover, protecting us from its presence, for we are all dying anyway and in death&#39;s constructive destruction lies neogenesis.</p>
