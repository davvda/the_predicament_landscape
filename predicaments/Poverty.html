			<h2>Poverty</h2>
			<p><strong>Poverty is the state of one who lacks the financial or material resources to satisfy their basic, essential, normal, or socially required needs</strong>. Poverty is therefore relative to its surroundings. Predicament-wise, poverty generally refers to the poorest in the world who are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty">often undernourished, without access to basic services and water, who have less access to education, and suffer from much poorer health</a>. There are few, if any, places left in the world not participating in the global economy which leads to money and, more specifically, income to act as the main proxy for poverty. </p>
<p>The international extreme poverty line is currently set at 2.15 USD per day but with poverty being relative we see national poverty rates of 2.04 USD for Ethiopia and 24.55 USD for the United States. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief">The $2.15 poverty line, set by the UN, shows that globally close to one in ten people live in extreme poverty</a> whereas if we look at high-income countries with a poverty line of around 30 USD around 84% of the world population could be considered (relatively) poor. </p>
<p>Important to note is that a proxy is only a proxy. A nation can increase its average household income above the poverty line while the quality of life decreases. I would argue that <em>the</em> problem with global poverty rates is that it exists at all at the same time as there are obese people, overly wealthy people, miserable people who throw away food and have several cars. There is enough for everyone, at least for the time being, and if we are unable to allow one of the poorest countries, Ethiopia, to even afford to drink the coffee they&#39;ve grown themselves... Well, then something has to change on a deeper level.</p>
