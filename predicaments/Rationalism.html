<h2>Rationalism</h2>
<p><strong>Rationalism is the epistemological view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive</strong>. Rationalism and its main principles of logic, mathematics, and metaphysics are important tools for thinking but exclusive reliance on rational thinking risks the thinker ending up in a world of representation whose bonds with present reality are silently cut. The main method of ensuring the representations are grounded in reality is through science and quantification/mathematics which, as other predicaments detail, leads one to bias ones thinking towards what is quantifiable while having difficulty factoring in what isn&#39;t. It is important to note that rationalism in and of itself is not problematic. A lack of balance and an exclusive focus on rationalism as the be all and end all of the thinking process is what makes it into a current predicament. And remember, rationalisation is not rational. Rationalisation is having a conclusion and backfilling why that is the correct conclusion. Rationality should systematically do the opposite.</p>
