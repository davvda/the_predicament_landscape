<h2>Unbalanced longtermism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present.</p>
<cite>Albert Camus</cite>
</blockquote><p><strong>Several of our predicaments in the landscape come from an emphasis on the shortterm. Some initiatives counter this by emphasising the longterm, the far future</strong>. These also create predicaments. Cryogenics, geoengineering, interplanetary colonisation, mind-machine transfers, ending senescence, and other aims are commonly associated with longtermism. How much of a predicament this is can be discussed (as is the case with all predicaments) but there is something about longtermism that strikes me as highly artificial and untruthful. It badly hides the same hubristic desires that make up many of our other predicaments. Whatever infinity we want does not lie in duration but in the momentaneous, or so I think. </p><p>If we cannot balance the shortterm with the longterm we are fighting a losing battle against time and ourselves. Longtermism doesn't completely lack its valid points but, as with rationalism, it has become more and more a caricature of itself. And you can trust me on this, I'm a thought leader, transhumanist, futurist, and anthropreneur funded by YCombinator.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
