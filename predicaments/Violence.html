			<h2>Violence</h2>
			<p>What is violence? What you think of is probably physical violence - causing bodily harm to someone. <strong>Violence is any path that uses undue force</strong>. Now, does any wise path actually require any force at all? There is violence in thought, words, and actions. To end violence, therefore, we must first find peace in our thoughts and perceptions. </p>
	<p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
		<li><strong><a href="../Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a></strong> - We humans often use violence to force ourselves forward, to accelerate along a path covered with obstacles.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../Apathy.html">Apathy</a></strong> - Violence requires and generates apathy towards the victim. Who is the victim?</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../Avoiding uncertainty.html">Avoiding uncertainty</a></strong> - Certainty through violence. The slogan of modern man?</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../Carelessness.html">Carelessness</a></strong> - Violence is perhaps the exact opposite of care.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../Cognitive dissonance.html">Cognitive dissonance</a></strong> - Violence and cognitive dissonance have many connections. The two most clear ones are that cognitive dissonance often becomes a requirement for the wielder of violence when the victim's ability to fight back is low. The cognitive dissonance required to believe one to be a good person while throwing a baby out of a window and raping and killing the mother, as an example. The other is the cognitive dissonance required by both the perpetrator and the civilians on the perpetrator's side that justifies that violence. Just think for a moment... The other day I heard someone at my local gym scoff at the fact that there were protestors outside their university because a Swedish weapons manufacturer was there at a recruiting event. Now, this person is a fully reasonable person, relatively, and was fully entrenched in the opinion of the stupidity of these protestors. Meanwhile, clueless engineers mingle with students to find those most violently intelligent to work on efficient technology for killing humans. Apologies for this anecdote, maybe it sounds forced and far-fetched? I'm having difficulties with feelings of misanthropy at the moment. Every person who works with a certain weapon should have to live through its effects. You work designing missiles? Your family will have to sit inside a building while we practice firing at it. Fighter jets? We'll fly by your house shooting at it in the middle of the night. Ah, you work with surveillance? We'll track every step you and your children take and if a child speaks wrongly, we'll make them disappear. Don't worry, you'll get them back after the next sprint. It's on the kanban board.</li>

		<li><strong><a href="../Hobbesian views.html">Hobbesian views</a></strong> - Hobbes was right, turns of humans are nothing but violent beasts.

If certain crises end up snowballing into a world exclusively consisting of war and violence, what was the point of all this work anyway? What was the point of anything? It takes so much for a person to believe in and try to create positive change, it takes so little for their skull to crack.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../Lack of feeling needed.html">Lack of feeling needed</a></strong> - As the nations of the world increasingly threaten others with violence it makes me wonder if I should stop all activities I feel called to and simply make my family proud by joining the army.

		<li><strong><a href="../National borders.html">National borders</a></strong> - Twofold violence connection here. One is that national borders often result from acts of violence. The other is that drawing and then enforcing borders for someone else's land from a thousand miles away is a type of violence unheard of for much of human history.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="../News.html">News</a></strong> - News broadcasts broadly cast three categories: sport, weather, and violence. Were you born in the wrong time?</li>
