			<h2>Lack of the longterm</h2>
			<p>Modernity is controlled by the economic system and, in extension, politicians, institutions, business corporations, and the market. Most political terms are four years and in finance there is often talk of seven year market cycles. Most large-scale decisions fall within this range of time. It is unquestionable that <strong>we have a tendency to focus on the short-term</strong>. The seven year market cycle can be contrasted with something believed to originate in the Great Law of the Iroquois, namely the seven generation stewardship. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_generation_sustainability">concept urges the current generation to live and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future</a>. What would we do differently if we lived and worked to benefit the seventh generation into the future?</p>
