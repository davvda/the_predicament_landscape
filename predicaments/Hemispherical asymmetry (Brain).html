<h2>Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)</h2>
<p>In the words of Iain McGilchrist, the natural philosopher, scientist, and author of The Matter With Things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that nowadays we live no longer in the presence of the world, but rather in a re-presentation of it. The significance of that is that the left hemisphere’s task is to ‘re-present’ what first ‘presences’ to the right hemisphere. This re-presentation has all the qualities of a virtual image: an infinitely thin, immobile, fragment of a vast, seamless, living, ever-flowing whole. From a standpoint within the representation, everything is reversed. Instead of seeing what is truly present as primary, and the representation as a necessarily diminished derivative of it, we see reality as merely a special case of our representation – one in which something is added in to ‘animate’ it. In this it is like a ciné film that consists of countless static slices requiring a projector to bring it back into what at least looks to us like a living flow. On the contrary, however, reality is not an animated version of our re-presentation of it, but our re-presentation a devitalised version of reality. It is the re-presentation that is a special, wholly atypical and imaginary, case of what is truly present, as the filmstrip is of life – the re-presentation is simply what one might call the ‘limit case’ of what is real. Stepping out of this world-picture and into the world, stepping out of suspended animation and back into life, will involve inverting many of our perhaps cherished assumptions.</p>

</blockquote><p>McGilchrist makes the case that <strong>the major underlying dynamic behind the issues of modernity lies in the left hemisphere having become the master of the right</strong>, rather than the right being master of the left. Both hemispheres and, more generally, all facets of the human mind are vital to our survival and becoming as living beings, but when our narrow representations of reality get to rule the living world we are in deep trouble.</p><p><strong>Outgoing connections:</strong></p><ul>
