<h2>No value in maintenance</h2>
<p><strong>To maintain is to keep something in its proper condition and, maybe more importantly, an expression of love for material and immaterial objects requiring care, time, and work</strong>. </p>
<p>Alex Vuocolo writes in an <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/">article</a> on the disappearing art of maintenance that it &quot;distinguishes itself rhetorically from sustainability. Sustainability is a state; maintenance is a process. It requires work, and work of a certain type. Whatever its ultimate goal — safety, material efficiency, reducing carbon emissions — practical know-how and repetitive labor come first. This kind of pragmatism is sorely needed in the climate debate, which is so often preoccupied with end-states that it has no earthly or humanly way of achieving.&quot; </p>
<p>Maintenance might be one of the most important but undervalued types of work. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real people who hold our civilization together are the maintenance people. If it weren't for them - pumping water out of subways, painting bridges to keep from rusting, fixing a steam pipe that is 70 years old - we'd be sunk. If we got rid of all the politicians and the policymakers in the world, the world would keep going. If you get rid of maintenance people, the whole thing breaks down.</p>
