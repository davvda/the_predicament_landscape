			<h2>Dogmatism</h2>
			<p><strong>Dogmatism is the arrogant and/or stubborn assertion of an opinion or a belief</strong>. It is often in practice the opposite to pragmatism which deals with actual occurences and facts, or empiricism which is the view that the only source of knowledge or truth is experience. A dogmatic individual holds their beliefs unquestionably as truths, commonly in the form of systems of principle and doctrines. A different way to look at dogmatism is as a cramped up, frightened, and grasping relative to faith.</p>
