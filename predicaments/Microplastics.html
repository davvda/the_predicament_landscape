<h2>Microplastics</h2>
<p><strong>Microplastics are small fragments of any type of plastic</strong> (&lt;5 mm). Unless they are designed to be biodegradable they tend to accumulate in the environment, particularly in water but also the air and soil. They are mobile, persistent, and difficult to remove from nature. <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/microplastics-from-textiles-towards-a">Over 80% of the microplastic in the environment comes from textiles, tires, and city dust</a>. The environmental and health impacts of microplastics are uncertain but it isn&#39;t unreasonable to think that an accumulation of synthetic non-degradable material in all living organisms could end up being catastrophic. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although man’s record as a steward of the natural resources of the earth has been a discouraging one, there has long been a certain comfort in the belief that the sea, at least, was inviolate, beyond man’s ability to change and to despoil. But this belief, unfortunately, has proved to be naïve.</p>
