			<h2>Lobbyism</h2>
			<p><strong>Lobbying is the act of attempting to influence that actions, policies, or decisions of government officials</strong> and is an activity increasingly dominated by corporations serving their own business interests. Lobbyism is also the practice of the market capturing and affecting the state and rule of a nation. Lobbyism kills democracy, if it hasn&#39;t already done so. It might also end our civilisation and, worst case, contribute to wiping out most life on Earth. </p>
<p>Lobbyism is a <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/lobby">hall</a> of cracked mirrors and gold-framed aristocratic portraits of drooping beardless chins.</p>
