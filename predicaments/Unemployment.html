			<h2>Unemployment</h2>
			<p>There is much work that needs doing in the world, maybe now more than ever before, but this work does not fit neatly in the current job market. Most jobs are not work. <strong>Most employment is worthless</strong>. Even within the mainstream progress narrative the modern notion of jobs and employment is ridiculous. Since the industrial revolution the promise of technological development and increased efficiency has been the abolishment of labour, yet we seem to be moving further and further away from fulfilling that promise. The main reason for this is, unsurprisingly, the growth imperative. Unemployed people are not contributing to spinning the wheel of the machine so politicians want to report lowered unemployment as a sign of success. With very few exceptions, there is too much work to do to be employed. In response to people being unemployed I once heard an older man respond angrily that &quot;someone has to steer the ship&quot; and I&#39;m still not sure who he was referring to.</p>
