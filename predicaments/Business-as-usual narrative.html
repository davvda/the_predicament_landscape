<h2>Business-as-usual narrative</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve made it this far along this path so why should there be any reason to leave it and stray into the wild? It has given us so much, can&#39;t you see, we just need to manage inflation a bit more, calm things down in the Middle East, and move our data to the cloud and then the economy kicks back in and all will be sunshine and continued glory, be a bit realistic! If it isn&#39;t that clearly stated there is at least an undercurrent in many people&#39;s behaviour that <strong>there is no other option than to continue.</strong> Business as usual. Except nothing about our modern day business is usual. Most of the things we do are moments of profound strangeness compared to all of human history. Withholding judgements of our acts as good or bad, simply that they are highly unusual. Our business-as-usual narrative takes for granted that things will continue indefinitely the same way they&#39;ve been for a tiny part of human history, extrapolating from almost nothing. Many curves of human impact are verticalising, meaning their exponentiality is becoming obvious, and there is nothing business-as-usual about exponential events. Business-as-usual is dead and gone and the sooner we act like it the better.</p>
