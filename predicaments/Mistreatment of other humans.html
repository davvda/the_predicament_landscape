			<h2>Mistreatment of other humans</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>A fool sees himself as another, but a wise man sees others as himself.</p>
				<cite>Dogen Zenji</cite>
				</blockquote>
			<p>Quite an obvious one, is it not? Although, I would claim that as a predicament this one points to two separate mistreatments of other humans. One is <strong>the deliberate and intentional mistreatment of humans</strong>, unrelated to what motivates said mistreatment. Killing, raping, enslaving, abusing, isolating, marginalising, excluding, etc. The other, more fickle, all-encompassing, and hidden is <strong>the global systemic mistreatment of other humans somehow unfit for the life of modernity</strong>. There exist no righteous, reasonable, or even acceptable motivations for the mistreatment of those who stand in the way of the stampede of modernity and, sadly, the more crippled, blind, and injured modernity becomes the less it cares about what it tramples as it moves ahead. </p>
<p>The main issue with this predicament is that most of us don&#39;t recognise or acknowledge our complicity in the mistreatment of other humans. Why should we? Aren&#39;t we enlightened and good people? Well, no, it might be true for christmas presents but for most actions it is not the thought that counts.</p>

	<li><strong><a href="../Biased evidence selection.html">Biased evidence selection</a></strong> - To keep the narrative of modernity alive as more and more people are mistreated the collection of evidence must be increasingly selective, increasingly skewed, increasingly excluding.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Blaming the people.html">Blaming the people</a></strong> - In situations of systemic mistreatment of others it is always easiest to blame the people. Either the people you mistreat, the people desiring their mistreatment, or both.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Despair.html">Despair</a></strong> - Internalise a fraction of the necessary mistreatment required for any Westerner to participate in society and it's difficult to avoid despair.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Dispositionism.html">Dispositionism</a></strong> - They simply have to be treated this way, it's just the way they are.</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Failure to take responsibility.html">Failure to take responsibility</a></strong> - Who takes responsibility for such apparently benevolent systemic mistreatment? How?</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Hobbesian views.html">Hobbesian views</a></strong> - Similarly to how colonialist narratives are utilised to justify our mistreatment of other humans we can double down on our Hobbesian views of humans as justification for our mistreatment.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Ignorance of interconnectedness.html">Ignorance of interconnectedness</a></strong> - Many people reading this might feel unaffected by the mistreatment of others. After all, why would the suffering of people on the other side of the world affect you?</li>

	<li><strong><a href="../Immoral justifications.html">Immoral justifications</a></strong> - The dominating narratives require constant justifications.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Migration.html">Migration</a></strong> - People often migrate to get away from certain mistreatment.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="../Mistreatment of animals.html">Mistreatment of animals</a></strong> - Since we value humans more than animals the acceptance of the severity of mistreatment of animals and humans will go hand in hand.
