<h2>Waste</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!</p>
<p>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.</p>
<p>This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.</p>
<p>What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.</p>
<p>The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us.</p>
<p>The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.</p>
<p>The danger is to the body, and it can kill.</p>
<p>The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.</p>
<p>The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waste">Waste is anything discarded as worthless or of no use</a></strong>. To waste is to use something carelessly. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-waste-generation">majority of material waste comes from mining</a> and quarrying which, in 2019, was at around 450 million tonnes compared with household material waste at around 2 million that same year. There&#39;s nothing wrong with doing your recycling to play your part but just keep that disparity in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully. </p>
