			<h2>Elderly care</h2>
			<p>Older people are useless, a burden on society. They have nothing to contribute with while they leech money, time, and work from us all. Well, yes, because we make them useless and, trust me, they would like nothing more than to contribute and be of use while living a life of leisure and rest after years of labour. Many cultures refer to older people as elders and the contribution of the elders was often caring for and passing on knowledge and wisdom to the younger people, and particularly the children, of the culture, deepening the cultural roots of the people, making sure the chain of wisdom stretching to the beginning of time never broke. </p>
<p><strong>Modernity leaves older people alone in their homes until death comes knocking</strong>, relatives perhaps visiting when they happen to be in the area, if they have relatives, or in old folk&#39;s homes tended to by underpaid nurses and apathetic youngsters.</p>
