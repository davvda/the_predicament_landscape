<h2>Illusion of understanding</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Explanation is a well-dressed error.</p>
<cite>Julio Cort√°zar, Hopscotch</cite>
</blockquote><p>True <strong>understanding cannot be explained or boiled down to concepts or models</strong>. True understanding and the understanding of truths lies beyond the verbal and explainable and modern civilisation is, unfortunately, unknowingly, constantly conflating explanations with understanding. As a predicament, the illusion of understanding presents us with a world that never makes real sense with the explanations we have, it doesn't behave the way we expect or want. In short, everything is infinitely more complex than we can know and, since it is comforting and often useful to place the world within the frames of concepts, models, principles, and laws, we end up with an illusion of understanding the world, missing that it stretches outside of the frames, endlessly in all directions.</p><p>Connections:</p><ul>
