 <br>Acceleration means an increase in velocity. Many things that rapidly approach a multifaceted collapse are constantly accelerating, seemingly unmoved by attempts to halt them. There are many reasons for the acceleration and, to name one, economic growth doesn't just result in acceleration, it demands it for its continuance.<br>
We are flooring it.<br>
The soles of our Converse<br>
worn down to bare feet,<br>
the heat of the pedal searing the skin.<br>
We are underage,<br>
under the influence,<br>
Wunderbaum's scent<br>
replaced with burnt rubber.<br>
We no longer know where we're headed<br>
but we think we've caught up<br>
with the horizon,<br>
high above the clouds.<br>
The infant in the backseat is still asleep.<br>
As long as we're going faster,<br>
we tell ourselves<br>
with tears or sweat or it doesn't matter<br>
running down our face,<br>
we'll get there.

 <br>Access to food means having access to the necessary energy and nutrients to live. This means living in a place where one can grow fruits and vegetables, one can hunt or fish, raise livestock, forage and gather wild plants and fungi, or have food transported to one's location.<br>
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.

 <br>
Things are tougher than we are, just<br>

However we mess it about;<br>
Chuck filth in the sea, if you must:<br>
The tides will be clean beyond.<br>
– But what do I feel now? Doubt?
Philip Larkin
<br>Access to water means just that. Water for drinking, washing, hearing, seeing, feeling, swimming, fishing, living in and with. I want you to imagine your favourite body of water. Maybe a gurgling creek, a calm forest lake, a beach with crashing waves, whatever comes to mind. In your mind's eye, what do you see? Look around, look at the water's surface, if you see anything underneath, the movement or stillness of the water, what it reflects, how it refracts, if other animals are interacting with it, if anything is disturbing its flow or stillness. What do you hear? What do you smell? Imagine it in as much detail as you can or, even better, actually go there. Now listen to this: "Water is an inorganic compound which is transparent, tasteless, and odorless". The poetry of modernity sure is striking. No wonder we're so happy.<br>Access to water is access to life, bursting with colour, the taste of the freshness of being, the scent of endless rebirth.<br>
Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.<br>
After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

Craving without self-control is the bread and butter of capitalism. Alcohol and the "typical" drugs, but also food, sugar, shopping, gambling, porn, sex, social media, games, medications, entertainment, TV, work, thought, spiritual, pain, money, exercise, etc. Addiction is the ideal driver of stable, predictable, and sustained consumption and behaviour and, furthermore, an addicted population will exhibit an intrinsic control system towards a life that is in balance with their addiction, rarely deviating too far in any direction. It must surely be rare that heroin addicts protest against the manufacturing of heroin?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

It includes crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.<br>The introduction of agricultural practices during the Neolithic revolution more than 10,000 years ago started transitioning most of humanity from a life of hunting and gathering to a settled life of farming. It is not unreasonable to see this as the starting point of many of our predicaments. Even though that may be stating things too simplistically this change in our ways of life undeniably defines much of what life is for us in modern times. Importantly though, the magnitude of this change exploded during the last millennium. A thousand years ago around 4% of Earth's usable land was used for farming. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use" target="_blank">This number today falls somewhere around 50%</a>. With half of our planet being actively cultivated, our agricultural practices matter greatly.<br>
...where ever food is grown the growing of it will raise the same two questions: How do you preserve the land in use? And how do you preserve the people who use the land?

Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.

<br>Algorithmic curation is the organising and presentation of online media using algorithms designed to personalise the content shown. Its purpose is mainly to increase the platform's revenue by keeping the user coming back and staying for longer. It takes the power of choice and agency from the user and instead puts it in the platform's hands, portraying this switch as something beneficial for the user. Algorithmic curation can be used for good but will mainly follow the incentives and top priorities of the owners of the platforms, these priorities are seldom the well-being of its users.<br>Algorithmic curation, in its present form and with its current surroundings, leaves us scrolling, paying, unhappy, horny, angry, and unknowingly obedient. Eat the rich.<br>
Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.

 <br>
The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.
Mahatma Gandhi
<br>The Abrahamic religions put us, contrary to most spiritual precedents, in a garden where animals where then placed alongside us to be in our service. These religions didn't necessarily start this but they contain clear mythologies of our historical thinking.<br>As our civilisation has become increasingly sophisticated (bunny ears on that one, I suppose) our views on other animals have become increasingly barbaric. It is important to note that the animal rights movement isn't something new. Jainism and its concept of ahimsa (refraining from the destruction of life) is around 3000 years old and animistic traditions reach back to, and might even in some ways precede, the rise of humans. Different animal views than ours are not just possible, they're historically more common and less complicated to justify.<br>

 <br>Apathy means the absence of suffering, lack of feelings, or passionlessness. More generally however, apathy means simply not caring or not experiencing any emotions. In this sense, apathy is opposed to sympathy (feeling for) and empathy (feeling with) and tends to go hand in hand with inaction, complicity, and passivity.

 <br>
The specific patterns, out of which a building or a town is made<br>
may be alive or dead. To the extent they are alive, they let our inner<br>
forces loose, and, set us free; but when they are dead they keep<br>
us locked in inner conflict.
Christopher Alexander
<br>Architecture is the art and technique of designing human constructions. It is a field which reaches far into the realms of the practical, pragmatic, and utilitarian, while simultaneously reaching into the depths of aesthetics, beauty, and nature. It is also a field whose reach in one direction is easily measured while the other direction isn't. The forces of modernity will then have its way with architecture and this, among other things, is what has lead modern architecture to become what it currently is. Quoting Encyclopedia Britannica's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture" target="_blank">article</a> on architecture, you cannot separate the two reaches of architecture, "because every society—settled or nomadic—has a spatial relationship to the natural world and to other societies, the structures they produce reveal much about their environment (including climate and weather), history, ceremonies, and artistic sensibility, as well as many aspects of daily life".<br>
The world of utility and the world of beauty are not separate realms.

Art is the creative expression of culture and life. Art attempts to capture and communicate the unspeakable. Art is the highest level of skill and any skill or act can become art. How and why has art become a predicament? Mainly, but not entirely, due to commodification. In order to live as an artist one needs knowledge of market forces, skills in marketing, efficiency over craft, ability to constrain creativity, prepare to work in advertisement, and reject the mode of existence that art demands. If art dies, culture dies. Luckily, art historically seems to be the one immortal cultural resistance. Art, however, needs to remain free to expand.<br>

 <br>Attention hijacking means getting someone's attention through force or trickery. It is one of the most seemingly harmless but detrimental crimes against human minds that is accepted as normal in our modern world.<br>Attention is not merely a passive act. It is a creative one. What we choose to pay attention to is what will spring up out of new sources. What we choose to ignore will wither and die. The dominating culture of our time is a culture obsessed with doing. If we're not doing something we're not doing anything. I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the economies of attention to instead attend, tend to, and show tenderness to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Radical options are generally ways of managing our predicaments that are deemed too unrealistic and ambitious. We shouldn't fear radical options. We must rip out and restructure the very <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/radical" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/radical" target="_blank">roots</a> of our thoughts, ideas, practices, and ways of life. What must be done to ensure our continued survival is nothing short of radical so if someone claims you're being too radical you might be approaching a path forward.<br>
To be radical is to grasp things by the root.

Do not view mountains from the scale of human thought.
Dogen Zenji
<br>Sometimes we lack simple solutions, adequate answers, and obvious paths forward. This can be tremendously uncomfortable but it is crucial to stay with the questions and uncertainty in order to find the right path. We are bad at this. Mostly, we avoid uncertainty at all cost, instead convincing ourselves and others of the certainty of wrong answers and non-solutions. There are no easy answers to the predicaments we face, nor should there be, since we haven't yet managed to find the right questions.<br>
The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next.

There are so many different kinds of stupidity, and cleverness is one of the worst.
Thomas Mann
<br>To be reasonable is, or rather should be, to think through and to understand. Most features of our predicament landscape have arisen due to our commitment to (try to) be reasonable. Unreasonably reasonable. To stop deforestation is not seen as reasonable, to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://theconversation.com/sweden-has-vast-old-growth-forests-but-they-are-being-chopped-down-faster-than-the-amazon-218753" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://theconversation.com/sweden-has-vast-old-growth-forests-but-they-are-being-chopped-down-faster-than-the-amazon-218753" target="_blank">cut down most of the old growth forests</a> apparently is. Reasoning has its merits but it seems we must dare to be a bit unreasonable to be able to manage our modern predicaments. All reasoning tends to follow a certain optimisation and prioritisation and if we haven't figured out what to optimise for (meta-optimisation) our reasoning has little value.<br>

 <br>Biased evidence selection means selecting true facts that support only one side of an argument. A fact being true doesn't mean you have the whole truth about something. Many things in the world have gotten better the past hundred years and many things have gotten worse, only looking at one side will give you an untrue model of the world. Two opposing facts about something can both be true. In fact, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-36394-8_39" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-36394-8_39" target="_blank">truths rarely come without contradictions</a>. Healthcare can both have gotten better and worse. Education can both have gotten better and worse. The Rosling-Pinker narrative tends to go hand in hand with the naive progress narrative claiming that everything is getting better and with time and technology we will end up living in a utopia.<br>To illustrate this we can look at Hans Rosling's famous example of washing machines. In short, he saw washing machines as a proxy for increased equality and socio-economic status. Women wouldn't need to spend all that time on tough manual labour every day to keep their families' clothes clean. Instead they could now... Well, what? Important to note is that I have no intention of glorifying either poverty or manual labour, rather, I want to point out the opposite side of a commonly one-sided evidence of progress. What the women freed from the labour of washing clothes now have more time for is, most often, working in the global economic system. This could be getting a job in a factory. What might end up happening is that women who had a routine of washing clothes with other women in the community, talking, gossiping, building relations, and being home and caring for their children now have less time in their local community, less time with their children, but more time working for someone else. If a factory gets built near a community, allowing the community to earn enough money to buy washing machines, the factory is seen as a humanitarian success, the backside being a lack of time and potentially a polluted river where once women were working and singing together. Or not. Do we believe we understand?<br>
Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing<br>
and rightdoing, there is a field.<br>
I'll meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass<br>
the world is too full to talk about.

From that time forth he believed that the wise man is one who never sets himself apart from other living things, whether they have speech or not, and in later years he strove long to learn what can be learned, in silence, from the eyes of animals, the flight of birds, the great slow gestures of trees.

<br>Biodiversity is often defined as "the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region". Another definition might be variety of life. Biodiversity loss could therefore be seen as a reduction in the variety of life.<br>Biodiversity loss can include the decrease, disappearance, or extinction of a species in a specific area or globally. The current primary driver of biodiversity loss appears to be habitat destruction (mainly for agriculture), which includes deforestation, as well as climate change more generally. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss" target="_blank">The current rate of global biodiversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 higher than the naturally occurring rate which is faster than at any other time in human history</a>.<br>The ongoing biodiversity loss is sometimes called the holocene extinction, or the sixth extinction.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The system of the free market claims to simply give people what they need and want. If what the people claim to need and want is good for them or not is beyond the market to decide. This rationale leads to the common viewpoint of blaming the people or the individual for whatever effects their actions have on themselves, others, and the planet. According to this viewpoint it is up to each individual to act morally and correctly for their own and others' well-being and, when they fail to do so, take the sole responsibility for their failures. Blaming the people for their behaviour in systems that condition and control them tends to go hand in hand with behaviour that is much more morally corrupt than the behaviour being blamed. Humans are one of the most adaptable animals on Earth and will adapt to whatever systems and conditions they're in. Don't blame people, blame their systems.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

If you are unable to find the truth right where you are, where else do you expect to find it?
Dogen Zenji
<br>The algorithmic recommendation systems of the internet in general and social media in particular is leading to a breakdown in information infrastructure, hindering the flow of truthful information in favour of whatever stirs emotion and increases engagement and retention. Modern informational systems rely on capturing and holding attention in order to stay financially competitive. These incentives are detrimental to our information infrastructures. Further, the way we gather information about the world has failed to keep up with modernity's exponential increase in complexity.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Anthropologist David Graeber <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs" target="_blank">contends that over half of societal work is pointless and becomes psychologically destructive when paired with work ethic that associates work with self-worth</a>. These meaningless and pointless jobs are what he call bullshit jobs. Graeber categorises these bullshit jobs into five categories; flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important; goons, who act to deceive others on behalf of their employer; duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be permanently fixed; box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not; and taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it. Thinking about most modern knowledge work and it isn't difficult to make the case that they're mostly pointless. Now, not all work has to be useful, rather, this becomes a problem when the bullshit jobs stop us from doing the actual work that needs doing. If you're stoked about the financial incentive for a new mother to prioritise her work as an agile scrum master for an IT-consultancy over her child, seeing it as a sign of our time's superior gender equality, I'm unsure of what to say.<br>Some criticism of Graeber's work writes that "bullshit 'taskmasters' and 'goons' such as hedge-fund managers or lobbyists reported that they were vastly satisfied with their work, while essential workers like refuse collectors and cleaners often felt their jobs were useless". It is hilarious to me that this isn't written with irony. I'm happy to hear that lobbyists and hedge-fund managers find meaning in their work, it shows me that the plasticity of the human mind is so enormous there might be hope for change. Jesus Christ. Fuck off.<br>There exist many types of jobs where, if they all stopped, society would become chaos. There are also many jobs where, if they all stopped, not only would nothing happen, we might actually manage to avoid chaos. Although, rest assured that hedge-fund managers are still needed, what would we possibly do without them?<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/ketamine_mentalhealth.png"><br>Outgoing connections:<br>

<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy" target="_blank">Bureaucracy is a system of organisation where decisions are made by non-elected officials</a> and is modern civilisation's main administrative system governing any institution. Characterised by hierarchy, continuity, impersonality, and specialised expertise it is the perfect opposite of what our predicament landscape needs. Hierarchy will ensure that the impersonal top level bureaucrats continue gaining from their expertise no matter the external effects. Bureaucracy is a highly centralised form of management and therefore hinders opportunities for emergence and decentralised responses to societal disruptions. Centralisation is not necessarily bad but it reduces a society's ability to respond in a sufficiently complex manner to complex situations.<br>It is not improbable that while modern civilisation collapses under its own weight, the rulers will trudge through the warm rusted desert sand of our attics, clutching their hairless chests, carrying their desks on their backs, shuffling their feet to the ticking of the typewriters.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>We've made it this far along this path so why should there be any reason to leave it and stray into the wild? It has given us so much, can't you see, we just need to manage inflation a bit more, calm things down in the Middle East, and move our data to the cloud and then the economy kicks back in and all will be sunshine and continued glory, be a bit realistic! If it isn't that clearly stated there is at least an undercurrent in many people's behaviour that there is no other option than to continue. Business as usual. Except nothing about our modern day business is usual. Most of the things we do are moments of profound strangeness compared to all of human history. Withholding judgements of our acts as good or bad, simply that they are highly unusual.<br>Our business-as-usual narrative takes for granted that things will continue indefinitely the same way they've been for a tiny part of human history, extrapolating from almost nothing. Many curves of human impact are verticalising, meaning their exponentiality is becoming obvious, and there is nothing business-as-usual about exponential events. Business-as-usual is dead and gone and the sooner we act like it the better.<br>
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

 <br>
We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.
Ursula K. Le Guin
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism" target="_blank">Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development occurs through the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market</a>. Capitalism, when it is combined with technological developments and increased energy availability, is probably the main concrete driver behind many of our problems, their current solutions and, importantly, one of the reasons for much of our increased material standard of living. As with most predicaments in the landscape it is crucial to identify not only what to reject, but how to balance the good with the bad for long-term thriving. There is plenty to criticise with the system of capitalism but this has to be done factoring in what it has done well in an attempt to bring that with us into whatever systems we choose as the alternative. For capitalism to continue in its current form there must be (more or less) infinite growth and with us approaching several planetary boundaries, and having passed many of them, continued growth is not a viable option, meaning capitalism most likely isn't one either, at least not in its current form.<br>
...all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the moneychangers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal.
Ursula K. Le Guin

 <br>Many cities are designed for cars. As with many predicaments, car-centric design has a complex and recursive causality chain. The more common it is to have a car, the further the distances between shops, workplaces, etc, and the further the distances are the more common it'll be to have a car. Car-centric design has ruined and is ruining our villages, cities, countries, and much of the world and, frankly, makes the world a better place for cars than for humans.<br>Christopher Alexander et al. write in A Pattern Language, "The problems stem essentially from the fact that a car is so much bigger than a person. Large parking lots, suited for the cars, have all the wrong properties for people. They are too wide; they contain too much pavement; they have no place to linger. In fact, we have noticed that people speed up when they are walking through large parking lots to get out of them as fast as possible". What does their research suggest is a large parking lot, you ask? One that fits more than seven cars. Seven.<br>
Beyond a certain speed, motorized vehicles create remoteness which they alone can shrink. They create distances for all and shrink them for only a few.
Ivan Illich

 <br>The dominating proxy for climate change has become carbon or, rather, CO2e. Becoming "carbon neutral" seems to be the main goal for many corporations and nations. Putting doubts about the truth of that claim aside, we could probably become carbon neutral or even carbon negative and still continue our vociferous dive into a lifeless, dystopian, scorched earth abyss. Don't get me wrong, carbon dioxide emissions are likely the main cause of global warming and overall climate change, but being the cause and being the driver are two very different things. We will definitely have to dramatically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, preferably 50 years ago, but the second best time to plant a tree yadda yadda, however, it will not suffice as a solution to global warming, climate change, or any other predicament. But of course, if you are against domestic abuse and you are currently beating your partner to death, it's a good plan to stop, but it's just the start of the healing process. If healing is what you want, that is.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Care has its roots in lamentation, grief, burdens of mind, and concern. What, then, does it mean to care? Caring, in its most encompassing meaning, is the understanding and internalisation of the losses and deaths of any act or moment, the awareness of the incessant songs of lamentation sounding across the world. When we are careless, when we are deaf to these tones, we bull our way through life without regard for neither life nor death, acting the role of the reaper we loathe.

 <br>
But it is one thing to read about dragons and another to meet them.
Ursula K. Le Guin, A Wizard of Earthsea
<br>A global catastrophic risk or an existential risk is a hypothetical event that could destroy most or all of humanity and/or life on Earth. The majority of existing catastrophic risks are anthropogenic, the exceptions being things like asteroid impacts, volcano eruptions, gamma-ray bursts, and the like. Reasoning about catastrophic risks is challenging, the reason for this being that even if the probability of the event is miniscule its consequences are disastrous. Weighing minimal risk with infinitely bad outcome can lead to nonsensical conclusions.<br>
As technology is empowering our choices and we are getting something like the power of gods, you have to have something like the love and the wisdom of gods to wield that or you self-destruct.

 <br>Centralisation is the process by which the activities of an entity become concentrated within a particular group within that entity, especially activities related to power and control. This power structure creates a hierarchy where those situated in the higher group has influence over the rest of the entity. Centralisation can occur on different scales and in different types of entities and can have many benefits. However, when decisions that threaten the power of the higher group are required for the entity's continued existence things tend to get complicated. Centralised power in an entity also tends to reduce its capacity for complex responses to complex situations, the main reason for this being a lack of possibility for spontaneous emergent behaviour within the entity. We don't need a conductor if we've reached the end of our classical symphony, we need to listen and become jazz musicians in one large multi-faceted improvisational mess. The next big thing is many small things.<br>
When small men begin to cast big shadows, it means that the sun is about to set.

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/climate_change.png"><br>Global changes in average temperature, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/climate" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/climate" target="_blank">from equator to poles</a>, means a change in the Earth's climate. The climate is never static but what makes climate change a predicament is the speed at which it is currently happening, threatening the stability of the Earth's climate system and thereby our survival. Put simply, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial practices add greenhouse gases which trap heat in the lower atmosphere. This leads to global warming and rapid climate change. The global nature of climate change means it contributes to and potentially creates several related predicaments. This is the main reason why climate change specifically is a main focus in the discussion of our continued survival. It is, however, not certain that lowering the global temperature by any means necessary will lead to the desired effects.<br>In some ways the predicament of climate change has been defined too narrowly, potentially leading to an illusion of understanding its complexity and thereby trusting that a solution is within our grasp as soon as we choose to grab it. This is one reason for why such a "simple" problem hasn't been prioritised at the cost of growth. Every predicament is interrelated but the increase in trapped energy on Earth might end up affecting all of them.<br>

 <br>
It was a Sunday in September. There would only be four.

<br>Modern society rests on the discipline of timekeeping. If you aren't following the time of the clock it will not be possible for you to partake, you will miss everything. Yet, I wonder what we are missing with our minds constantly framed in dates and minutes. When writing this we are currently between Rikka, when birds and frogs start singing the songs of summer, and Shōman, when the plants bloom and the wheat ripens, at least according to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://smallseasons.guide/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://smallseasons.guide/" target="_blank">small seasons of Japan</a>. It is morning but the sun is already high in the sky. The swifts should be arriving any day now, after their long flight from Africa, they'll nest in the eaves of our apartment building. They're somehow always on time, as if they knew our wedding day.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/clock.png"><br>It is estimated that humans started using something akin to clocks 5000-6000 years ago with the purpose of organising time more efficiently, most likely related to formal religions and certain social and societal activities. Modern clock time is globally coordinated across time zones whose main origin is the industrial revolution which brought factories and high-speed transportation that required accurate timekeeping. Similarly to the loss of wholeness of space and matter when only considering atoms, something is lost of the wholeness and flow of time when considering seconds. There is undoubtedly a usefulness in timekeeping but one must ask if this usefulness hasn't peaked way before we started to wake up, not with the sun, but with the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/29/foer.php" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/29/foer.php" target="_blank">oscillations of quartz crystals or going to sleep with the resonance of cesium atoms</a>.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/ignorance_of_collapse.png"><br>Cognitive dissonance is an experience of disturbance felt when beliefs and actions are contradictory, when the coherence between intentions and effects is lost to such an extent that the harmony between who you think you are, or want to be, clashes with what you actually do. This disturbance or discomfort can be approached in two ways. The first and potentially most prevalent method is to somehow modify, justify, or twist the inner workings to still somehow fit with your behaviour. Rationalisations, selective perception, and selection of confirming evidence are some methods of reducing cognitive dissonance, incoherence, and internal inconsistencies in general. The second method is to meet your cognitive dissonances head-on, firstly coming to terms with the fact that you aren't fully responsible for the tuning of the orchestra, and then working towards harmonious actions with the inherent impossibility of that asymptotic striving, resting in knowing that practice is enlightenment.<br>If we're all hypocrits, what will you do about it? Always keep in mind the spectral nature of any duality, nothing is purely dissonant or purely harmonious, the gap between them is a wondrous pilgrimage to spend one's life on. Be especially kind to those you meet on the way who seem the most dissonant, they might never have heard the blackbird over the screaming chainsaws.<br>
It's not the note you play that's the wrong note - it's the note you play afterwards that makes it right or wrong.

 <br>Today we don't bring god to other countries, we bring the global capitalist economic system. Or do we?<br>Colonialism is defined as the practice by which powerful countries control less powerful countries in order to increase their own power and wealth. Colonialism is often talked about as something historical, a mistake in the past, imperialist cruelty, but the modern world is packed to the brim with colonialist narratives and actions.<br>
Colonies are the outhouses of the European soul, where a fellow can let his pants down and relax, enjoy the smell of his own shit. [...] Out and down in the colonies, life can be indulged, life and sensuality in all its forms, with no harm done to the Metropolis, nothing to soil those cathedrals, white marble statues, noble thoughts... No word ever gets back. The silences down here are vast enough to absorb all behavior, no matter how dirty, how animal it gets...
Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow
<br>The real essence of colonialism is the forcing onto other peoples and places of the idea of separate things with impermeable boundaries, the story of separation.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>For a system to be resilient it is required to have complex responses to complex threats. When the behaviour of the threat is more complex than the response of the system it is unlikely that the system will respond in a way that ensures its continued existence. This is a complexity mismatch.<br>A simple illustrating example of a complexity mismatch with regards to ecosystems could be comparing an old growth forest to a planted forest. An old growth forest consisting of an intricate web of thousands or millions of organisms all contributing to the maintenance of their dwelling place makes it resilient to change, its complexity creating a nearly infinite amount of responses to any major destabilising event. In contrast to this a planted forest consisting of a single type of tree will most likely not have the time or the conditions to develop much complexity leading to the risk that even a minor destabilising event causes a complete collapse.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/complexity_mismatch.png"><br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake.
Richard Sennett, The Craftsman
<br>Craft is work that requires particular skills and knowledge and, related to craft as a predicament, the proper conditions for such work to be done. There are several factors impacting modern craft, threatening its existence. These factors might become clear when looking more closely at what craft tends to entail. In general, the artisan or craftsman spends time on two types of activities: small scale production and maintenance. Small scale production of goods by one or a few skilled craftsmen stands in opposition to mass-produced goods sold at prices so much lower than what the craftsman can charge to make a living. Maintenance work stands in opposition to disposability and consumerism at large and, further, the majority of mass-produced modern goods are rarely worth maintaining anyway.<br>The extinction of craft has deeper connotations for us as well, since craft stands tall as one of the most concretely poetic activities, the physical manifestations of human ingenuity. All work should strive to become a craft.<br>
Craftsmanship is not just about creating something beautiful, but about leaving a legacy for generations to come.

The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men.
John F. Kennedy
<br>Modern civilisation is, even more than in the past, a fight to be the one singular entity that wins over all others. Cultures are diverse, they should be. Most cultures have deep roots in unique places, traditions, art, literature, myths, peoples, and stories and cultural complexity, the depth and breadth of cultures, is needed for humanity's continued existence. Culture wars that attempt to erase other cultures either with the purpose of one culture "winning" or for one single homogenised culture to swallow all others will reduce humanity's complexity, meaning we'll be decreasingly capable of tackling any challenges we face.<br>
Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future.
Albert Camus

 <br>
Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, only in dying life: bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.
Ursula K. Le Guin, A Wizard of Earthsea
<br>Most cultures of modernity deal terribly with death. Maybe it is a part of reality that makes the artificial nature of our lives too clear for us. Death is a necessary part of life and the way we deal with death will reflect on how we deal with life. Once again, we have trouble with the broader view, complexity, infinity, and eternity. Do not put death under a cover, protecting us from its presence, for we are all dying anyway and in death's constructive destruction lies neogenesis.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/death.png"><br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Debt is an obligation that requires one party to pay for borrowed money from another party. The cost for the borrowed money is almost always more than the principal sum, the cost borrowed, since it includes interest. Interest is most often set at a particular rate, a percentage of the amount borrowed. Debt can also be anything that is owed to something or someone else, such as debt owed to coming generations due to our current and past treatment of the planet and its future.<br>Debt keeps individuals, businesses, governments, and other organisations and financial entities in a constant battle with the assumptions and attitudes about the future. It also makes any serious attempt to manage our predicaments potentially catastrophic since one must keep up with interest rates that depend on growth, assumed or actual, or accept bankruptcy.<br>Over the past many years we've been sent several reminders that our natural debt needs paying. The interest rate of global rising temperatures due to borrowing more fossil fuels than we can pay for has us staring global existential bankruptcy in the face.<br>
If history shows anything, it is that there's no better way to justify relations founded on violence, to make such relations seem moral, than by reframing them in the language of debt—above all, because it immediately makes it seem that it's the victim who's doing something wrong.

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/deforest.png"><br>Deforestation is the removal and destruction of forests. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation" target="_blank">The UN FAO estimate that 10 million hectares of forest are cut down each year.</a> Two points of importance: one is that there is a difference between deforestation and net forest loss since forests are also regrowing and being replanted, second is that deforestation peaked in the 1980s. It is, however, also important to note that not all forests are equal and here we run into the potential issue with relying too heavily on quantification. We could most likely make most of the planet net positive in forest growth quite quickly by planting trees faster than we're removing them. The question is if we have a reason to trust our claimed understanding of the differences between artificially planted forests and naturally growing ones. Maybe we do? Do we truly understand what a forest is or are we missing it for all the trees?<br>
There was a time when man* would walk in my woods, but now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.<br>
---<br>
I am not altogether on anybody’s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays.

 <br>Democracy is a system of government whereby the state is ruled by the people. This is most often achieved by having the rulers elected through voting by the people. Many governments today are, or claim to be, democratically elected governments. There are countless arguments as to why this might not necessarily be the case, and since democracy seems to be the least bad form of government system we have it is vital to not let democracy fail as, I believe, we currently are. The most obvious failings of democracy are technology, especially as it relates to media and information, and economy, specifically wealth disparities and overall expressions of modern capitalism. A simplified view perhaps, but a decent one nonetheless. Technology allows manipulation of the opinions of the masses while capitalism justifies wealth accumulation, and consequently, power disparities. This is not democracy.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Desert, in general, is a very good place to find yourself. Or lose yourself.

<br>Outgoing connections:<br>
<br><a data-href="Acceleration" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/acceleration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acceleration</a> - The forming of deserts in previously arable land unfortunately accelerates the very factors that cause the desertification in the first place.
<br><a data-href="Access to food" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/access-to-food.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access to food</a> - If I ask you to, in your mind's eye, picture the Middle East, what do you see? Most Syrian refugees in Europe are fleeing from conflict with complicated and complex causes, from an expanding desert that was once called the Fertile Crescent of the Earth.
<br><a data-href="Access to water" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/access-to-water.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access to water</a> - A drier climate drives desertification and desertification drives a drier climate.
<br><a data-href="Biodiversity loss" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/biodiversity-loss.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Biodiversity loss</a> - As with many things, there's nothing inherently wrong with deserts and even desertification is a natural process supporting certain species that thrive in such conditions. It becomes something problematic when considered in its totality and with its anthropogenic causes. Alright, think of it this way... During an ongoing sixth extinction it isn't great that deserts, which support a much lower biodiversity than forests, are expanding rapidly due to human activities.
<br><a data-href="Climate change" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/climate-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Climate change</a> - Many factors here but the most obvious is that deserts barely sequester any CO2 at all compared to forest land. Deserts are hot and contribute in making the world hotter.
<br><a data-href="Ecological crisis" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/ecological-crisis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ecological crisis</a> - Deserts are less fertile and complex and barely add anything to the resilience required for ecosystems to continue supporting human life.
<br><a data-href="Lack of a living world view" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/lack-of-a-living-world-view.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lack of a living world view</a> - If the Earth becomes an arid plain of desert pavement there won't be much heft to the argument of the world being animate and alive.
<br><a data-href="Mass climate migration" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/mass-climate-migration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mass climate migration</a> - When the sand dunes come leaking in through your front door it becomes increasingly difficult to justify staying when you see what appears to be fertile greenery on the horizon.
<br><a data-href="Migration" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/migration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Migration</a> - On a smaller but also more general scale than mass climate migration, it is usually economically beneficial to move from a desert to a more prosperous region, especially when deserts are expanding.
<br><a data-href="Resource conflicts" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/resource-conflicts.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Resource conflicts</a> - Firstly, when deserts expand certain natural resources become less available. Secondly, some natural resources such as oil suddenly become more extractable and chaos ensues. Local resource conflicts might escalate over the few patches of remaining greenery while nuclear powers fight over the black gold flowing in the veins of fertile death.
<br><a data-href="Soil erosion" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/soil-erosion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Soil erosion</a> - There is a recursive relationship between soil erosion and desertification where they both cause and expand each other.
<br><a data-href="Unheeded warnings" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/unheeded-warnings.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Unheeded warnings</a> - Desertification is nothing new and we've known about many of its causes and consequences for thousands of years.
<br><a data-href="War" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/war.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">War</a> - I'll let the UN summarise things, "Desertification is a silent, invisible crisis that is destabilizing communities on a global scale. As the effects of climate change undermine livelihoods, inter-ethnic clashes are breaking out within and across states and fragile states are turning to militarization to control the situation. The effects of desertification are increasingly felt globally as victims turn into refugees, internally displaced people and forced migrants or they turn to radicalization, extremism or resource-driven wars for survival. If we are to restore peace, security and international stability in a context where changing weather events are threatening the livelihoods of more and more people, survival options are declining and state capacities are overburdened, then more should be done to combat desertification, reverse land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought. Otherwise, many small-scale farmers and poor, land-dependent communities face two choices: fight or flight."

 <br>It seems to me that, in modern society, on the scale of individuals to all of humanity, we have solved the problem of direction by striving to move with higher speed. Going faster and having more will surely yield progress, inexorably lead to everything being better. If you are uncertain, perhaps rightfully so, as to where you should be going it is unwise to tackle this by simply going faster. On the contrary, the less certain you are the slower you should move, instead focusing on getting to grips with your present surroundings. Even if speed, magnitude, accumulation, growth, and restlessness got you to where you are now there are times where you must cease the unceasing motion and consider where you're headed, where your direction should be. If nothing else, stop, find a high point and see what's on the horizon.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

How gullible are you? Is your gullibility located in some "gullibility center" in your brain? Could a neurosurgeon reach in and perform some delicate operation to lower your gullibility, otherwise leaving you alone? If you believe this, you are pretty gullible, and should perhaps consider such an operation.

 <br>Dispositionism is a term in social psychology used to describe those that believe people's actions are conditioned by internal factors rather than the situation they find themselves in.

It is an excellent method of avoiding difficult problems and situations such as poverty, crime, addiction, and war among others.

A dogmatic individual holds their beliefs unquestionably as truths, commonly in the form of systems of principle and doctrines.

Once you learn to read the land, I have no fear of what you will do to it, or with it. And I know many pleasant things it will do to you.
Aldo Leopold
<br>Ecology is the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ecology" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ecology" target="_blank">study of our dwelling place</a>, more specifically a field of science studying the interconnected systems of Earth.<br>The ecological crisis is a destabilisation or breakdown of these systems large enough to threaten humanity's continued survival. It is, however, important to include other organisms in this since the ongoing man-made ecological crises are causing the extinction of multiple species every day. From a systems-thinking perspective every species going extinct reduces an ecosystem's options to restabilise after a destabilising event. It is therefore not unlikely that we end up snowballing the effects of climate change by reducing the resilience and complexity of ecosystems past the point where a recovery is possible.<br>

 <br>
Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the essential, the what is; and to awaken this capacity, in oneself and in others, is education.
J. Krishnamurti
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education" target="_blank">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills and traits</a> and means to bring forth. A crisis of education is therefore the potential or actual failure of this transmission and the failure to bring forth humans with the knowledge, skills, and traits needed to find their way in the world. Informal education's role has decreased while the increased role of formal education has narrowed to the point where much necessary knowledge and understanding requires an unlearning of one's formal education. Education, both formal and informal, is necessary for the prevailing of cultures but its current effects aren't just decreasingly constructive, they're also increasingly destructive.<br>
Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence.

 <br>Many educational systems are more about indoctrination and training than cultivating understanding. Education should create dependable, predictable, and productive humans for the global systems of commerce and civilisational expansion. In a world where, for our continued survival, we must question everything we thought we knew, the educational system will always be several steps behind, discouraging any curiosity to leave the boundaries of the curriculum. The mental tools that can make sure that the world of your grandchildren isn't destroyed or dystopian is nowhere in the curriculum, sorry 'bout that.<br>

 <br>
Wear your ego like a loose fitting garment.
Gautama Buddha
<br>The ego, the small self, the self-centered illusory center-self, the motivator of self-serving actions, the "I" that wants and desires, the separate "me", the voice that asks "what's in it for me?", the mental chatter you think is yours and you. The ego claims to be and justifies the self. Ego dynamics lie at the bottom of many predicaments and, if we don't learn to understand the ego for what it is, it will blindly rule us to ruin.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Older people are useless, a burden on society. They have nothing to contribute with while they leech money, time, and work from us all. Well, yes, because we make them useless and, trust me, they would like nothing more than to contribute and be of use while living a life of leisure and rest after years of labour. Many cultures refer to older people as elders and the contribution of the elders was often caring for and passing on knowledge and wisdom to the younger people, and particularly the children, of the culture, deepening the cultural roots of the people, making sure the chain of wisdom stretching to the beginning of time never broke.<br>Modernity leaves older people alone in their homes until death comes knocking, relatives perhaps visiting when they happen to be in the area, if they have relatives, or in old folk's homes tended to by underpaid nurses and apathetic youngsters.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Electric vehicles are vehicles that use electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles are potentially much more efficient than vehicles relying on fossil fuels but they come with other problems. Moving away from fossil fuel-dependent vehicles is of high importance but electric vehicles are often the right answer to the wrong question. Electric cars are not mainly meant to save the climate, they're meant to save the car industry. As with all predicaments we must consider where electric vehicle solutions fit in with the rest of the landscape. Beware of good solutions to the wrong problems.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>What stirs us up, agitates us? An emotional crisis is a state in which we are stirred up and agitated, internally and externally, to the extent that we lose control over our emotions and consequently the behaviours they might entail. Emotional crises could be expressed as depressive behaviours, anxiety, withdrawal, isolation, panic, paranoia, despair, sadness, anhedonia, and suicide. Defined differently it can also be seen as any state of crisis where emotions play a role in inhibiting proper responses, responsivity, or responsibility, potentially through situations being so complex that it becomes nearly impossible to know what a correct emotional reaction could be.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>It is not unlikely that our lives will fill the last pages of the short book of the history of our human civilisation. What does it mean to be at the end of history? Well, at the very least it means that we are at the dissolution of a certain narrative that has been constant throughout human civilisation, the narrative of progress and ascent. We will either reach the pinnacle of this progress curve, something I believe we have already failed to do, or this narrative and its resulting manifestations will collapse, something I believe it has already started to do.<br>In the words of John Milbank "we are not so much subject to passing tensions, potentially resolvable, as to the ultimate emergence of tensions latent in the very foundations of the modern". The dynamics that got us to this point, that created our progress, are the same dynamics which create our downfall. Therefore, we must either redesign and rebuild our foundations or watch it all crumble. One of our most complicated problems is that we have built so many unsteady structures on top of this rotting foundation that it looks to be impossible to even approach the foundation without risking a complete collapse.<br>No matter what we do or where we go, we are at the end of history.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways.
Gautama Buddha
<br>Evil is the exponential externalisation of internal suffering. It is an unleashing of inner demons into the world, their power multiplied by hatred, revenge, destruction, death, pain, apathy, and war. Every person must overcome their own evils.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>
<br><a data-href="Big tech" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/big-tech.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Big tech</a> - Much of big tech is driven by evil intentions.
<br><a data-href="Blaming the people" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/blaming-the-people.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaming the people</a> - To blame the people for one's own acts of evil or insufficiencies in dealing with the world is nothing other than despicable.
<br><a data-href="Colonialist narratives" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/colonialist-narratives.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Colonialist narratives</a> - Without colonialist narratives the colonialists might have to face their own evil past and present.
<br><a data-href="Ego" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/ego.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ego</a> - Evil speaks mainly through the voice of the ego.
<br><a data-href="Fear" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/fear.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fear</a> - What came first, the chicken or the egg? Fear or evil?
<br><a data-href="Genocide" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/genocide.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genocide</a> - Evil drives killing.
<br><a data-href="Greed" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/greed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Greed</a> - Greedful acts can be badly disguised evil acts.
<br><a data-href="Immoral justifications" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/immoral-justifications.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Immoral justifications</a> - There are sometimes discussions about evil existing at all. This is understandable when our vision is obscured by all of these complicated justifications for everything.
<br><a data-href="Industrial slaughter" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/industrial-slaughter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Industrial slaughter</a> - The industry of slaughter is, I think, without a single doubt, going to be regarded as the most evil act ever done on Earth in all its history by any being. It is a system so far beyond morality and goodness that it's nearly unspeakable.
<br><a data-href="Lack of cultural control systems" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/lack-of-cultural-control-systems.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lack of cultural control systems</a> - Many cultures have had clear control systems for managing and hindering acts of evil and instead cultivating balance and harmony. We are not part such a culture. Our culture(s) rewards evil as long as it is indirect and untraceable.

Evil is one of them. When humans seem inherently to harbour so many demons, what hope and faith can there be?
<br><a data-href="Lack of love" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/lack-of-love.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lack of love</a> - Evil destroys love.

<br><a data-href="Mistreatment of animals" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/mistreatment-of-animals.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mistreatment of animals</a> - To purposely mistreat other beings might be the definition of an evil act.
<br><a data-href="Mistreatment of other humans" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/mistreatment-of-other-humans.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mistreatment of other humans</a> - Same as above but more complicated.
<br><a data-href="Multipolar traps" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/multipolar-traps.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Multipolar traps</a> - Evil combined with multipolar traps generate races to the bottom of everything. The corpses laying within the multipolar traps of history often wear their evil grins until they're nothing but bones.
<br><a data-href="Nihilism" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/nihilism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nihilism</a> - Evil needs nihilism. To nihilists, there is no such thing as evil so why should it matter what evil one spreads?
<br><a data-href="Nuclear war" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/nuclear-war.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuclear war</a> - One of the most extreme exponential acts of evil is the detonation of atom bombs.

<br><a data-href="Power concentration to the wrong people" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/power-concentration-to-the-wrong-people.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Power concentration to the wrong people</a> - To seek nothing but power is often an act of evil. A surprisingly rewarding act for the people with the required competence.
<br><a data-href="Propaganda" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/propaganda.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Propaganda</a> - To get people on board with your own evil it becomes necessary to make others believe in your agenda no matter how untruthful you must be to spread it.
<br><a data-href="Selfishness" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/selfishness.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Selfishness</a> - Evil lies at the very apex of selfishness.

<br><a data-href="Story of separation" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/story-of-separation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Story of separation</a> - The justifications and drivers of evil requires us to be separate from each other. Who knows, if people discover how much of their own feet they've blasted off, maybe they'd stop shooting?
<br><a data-href="The Dark Triad" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/the-dark-triad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Dark Triad</a> - The dark triad could also be called the triad of evil.
<br><a data-href="Views on human nature" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/views-on-human-nature.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Views on human nature</a> - We must not see human nature as something static whose proof of intrinsic corruption shows itself everywhere. Human nature can be and become many things and evil is one of them. Importantly, it can become otherwise.

 <br>Exponential technologies are technologies that in one way or another follow an exponential path. This behaviour can be due to a technology that spreads exponentially across domains, grows exponentially in use, exhibits exponential intrinsic behaviour, requires exponential energy, or sees exponential progress in its own development. The number of real and potentially exponential technologies has increased with the invention of the computer. Whereas the expanding use of the steam engine required physical parts and specific knowledge, information through software travels at the speed of light. Humans lack intuition for exponential behaviours and care must be taken for us to not invent and develop our own doom. How to wisely handle exponential technologies is possibly one of our most difficult predicaments.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Extreme weather is any weather condition at the extremes of whatever has been observed and recorded in the past and includes heat waves, cold waves, storms, etc.<br>The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as "an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations."<br>Human activity is most likely the main driver of the increased frequency of extreme weather events.<br>Extreme weather can also act as warnings and omens. Will we listen?<br>

 <br>How are we failing to take responsibility? Why should we be held accountable for our actions at all? Having responsibility is having an obligation to respond for what one has done. Every externally affecting action, which means all actions, should come with a promise back to the source of that action. Since we live in endlessly complex and intricate webs of causality in the modern world it is increasingly difficult to take responsibility and to even know and understand what to take responsibility for. How should you be responsible for the emissions of the airplane you're travelling in? What about the food served on the plane, the titanium alloys used in manufacturing it, the noise of the engines, the price of your ticket contributing to the continuing unquestioned existence of airlines, etc. There is a blurry line here. When you cross this line you enter the infinite fields of karmic complexity. Karmic complexity does not necessarily belong in this predicament. <br>Largely, I believe the responsibility for many predicaments comes down, not to individuals, but institutions, corporations, and, most of all, human-created systems. As long as our systems fail to take responsibility for their externalities we will not manage this landscape. To be even more concrete, this isn't even a question of nuance and detail, it can be as simple as taking responsibility for one's own shit, literally and figuratively.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Meta-optimisation is optimising what you're optimising. In simpler terms, it is prioritisation. Every action we take can be seen as contributing to one long optimisation equation, consciously or not. There are times when what you optimise for is obvious, perhaps buying a car that maximises convenience while minimising cost. Most times, however, what you're optimising for is complicated and multi-faceted. Furthermore, many systems incentivise us to optimise badly. This is where meta-optimisation comes in. How do you make sure that if you want to optimise for a "life well lived", you have (meta)optimised your optimisation equation to actually yield that result? Now, this is an unanswerable question or, rather, it is a question you can spend several lives trying to answer, but while the perfect optimisation doesn't exist and constantly changes it is quite clear when an optimisation equation hasn't been correctly (meta)optimised. When this fact appears in stark relief, something has to change. When variables such as wealth keep increasing while variables such as time spent in old-growth forests (apologies to any hippiephobe), enjoyment of music, or pure joy have stopped increasing and may even be decreasing we have to re-meta-optimise.<br>Lastly, there is of course also the question of meta-meta-optimisation and meta-meta-meta-optimisation but that becomes a bit too meta at this time, even for me.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" target="_blank">Fear is an intensely unpleasant primal emotion in response to perceiving or recognising a danger or threat</a> and commonly leads to fight-or-flight reactions of different degrees. Importantly, thought influences our perception of what is or isn't a threat and our thoughts are further influenced by everything and everyone around us. Our complex modern surroundings lead to threats and dangers being less clear than in the primitive setting, where fear evolved, and therefore risks fear and its reactive behaviours becoming less congruent with reality. Another important note is that fear itself is rarely the problem. It is rather our perception of the world that can get muddied and generate fear where none is reasonable and vice versa. This is especially true when votes and wealth can be gained through instilling fear in others.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>There are, according to James Carse, two kinds of games. Finite games are played for the purpose of winning and infinite games for the purpose of continuing the play. An infinite game can contain one or more finite games, a finite game cannot contain an infinite game. Modernity has chosen to exclusively focus on finite games. Finite games keeps us wrongly competitive, static, hostile, individualist, tribal, polarised, suspicious, miserable, and blindly heading for destruction. Infinite games lead us to be cooperative, dynamic, open, inclusive, ever-changing, engaged, and adaptive to whatever may come our way.<br>Life is an infinite game filled with finite games. James Carse again: "Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do". How much in your life feels like a decision taken for you, something you must do?<br>
Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.

 <br>Look around at the objects around you and try to figure out how many parts of the world have been involved in the production of those objects. Global supply chains are spread out across the world and include the flow of information, processes, and resources.<br>Fragile global supply chains are sensitive to disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic showed clearly the lack of resilience of modern day global supply chains. As our civilisation tries to weather transition and collapse these low-probability high-impact events are likely to occur more often risking even larger disruptions to global supply chains.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
If voting made any difference they wouldn't let us do it.
Mark Twain
<br>A government is a system and/or group ruling a community. The purpose of government is to steer and direct the community it serves/rules. There exist several types of governmental systems, each of which presents its own predicaments and problems. Governments rule mainly through creating and enforcing laws.<br>
Governments want efficient technicians, not human beings, because human beings become dangerous to governments – and to organized religions as well. That is why governments and religious organizations seek to control education.

 <br>
So the unwanting soul<br>
sees what's hidden,<br>
and the ever-wanting soul<br>
sees only what it wants.
Lao Tzu
<br>Greed is complicated. It's often defined as the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/greed" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/greed" target="_blank">excessively eager desire to possess</a> and is commonly talked about as one of the drivers of capitalism, the basic fundament of human nature. I would argue that greed is a response to fear of scarcity, either in the present moment or projected into the future. Capitalism rewards accumulation, drives fear of scarcity, and generates and maintains greed.<br>
Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.

 <br>Greenwashing is a form of advertising where organisations try to persuade the public that they are more environmentally friendly than they are. I have seen few examples of organisations claiming to be environmentally friendly who aren't simply greenwashing. I also believe greenwashing goes further than advertising. For example, carbon accounting might appear honest and organisations who choose to be public about their emissions sometimes mean well. However, these numbers mostly serve to greenwash their operations on a deeper level unless those emission numbers aren't all-encompassing and accurate as well as concretely acted upon. Greenwashing also furthers the issue of people destroying the world with a good conscience, . If you incessantly insist that you're a good person there's a high chance that you're not.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>To grow is to increase, develop, get bigger, and, ideally, flourish. Growth in the predicament landscape mainly entails economic growth whose snooze-worthy definition is the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the services and goods produced by an economy over a certain amount of time, usually a year. When related to measurable material welfare growth might be the best thing that ever happened to humanity and if unchanged and extrapolated into the future it might very well be the worst. Growth cannot continue indefinitely and many of our current predicaments come from the fact that there are limits to our growth.<br>
Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction.

 <br>Calm down, hear me out. Modern healthcare is, in many ways, rightfully placed at the top of modern human achievement. There are about a billion asterisks to this statement, mainly consisting of arguments about the failure of accepting illness, suffering, pain, and death as well as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis" target="_blank">iatrogenic diseases</a> etc... But nonetheless, modern healthcare might be a reason why I can write this and why you can read it. So what's the problem, or rather, what's the predicament in modern healthcare? Once again, it is an issue with balance, optimisation, and the exclusion of non-quantifiable aspects of health. Let's look at an example.<br>Healthcare in Sweden is absolutely atrocious and also completely incredible. On the one side, for most health issues you will be met with different medical doctors each appointment, most of them only having a few stressful minutes to half-listen before sending you on your way without too much hassle and effort. Meeting human to human, trusting expertise, being listened to, finding help for mental health issues, being taken seriously, all of this is a rarity in healthcare. However, prove that your condition is serious enough and nurses, doctors, surgeons, therapists, priests, and, I'm sure, the prime minister, suddenly spawn out of nowhere and you're sent through a mechanistic wonder of expertise, reason, intuition, skill, efficiency, medical substances, all in order for you to come out the other side healthy and alive, barely paying a dime for it. There is something to this. Is it modernity excelling at treating sickness while being almost incapacitated with regards to health and a good life? Also, what roles do medications, something medical corporations profit from, play in the maintaining but not curing of a population? There is something to this. We have somehow gotten healthcare very wrong while getting parts of it very right. Why? Also, the way we tackle curing cancers never seems to include a conversation about halting the release of anthropogenic carcinogens? Why? Can we get healthcare right if we get everything else wrong?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
The search for pleasure is circular, repetitive, atemporal. The variety seeking of the spectator, the thrill hunter, the sexually promiscuous, always ends in the same place. It has an end. It comes to the end and has to start over. It is not a journey and return, but a closed cycle, a locked room, a cell.
Ursula K. Le Guin
<br>Hedonism refers to the prioritisation of pleasure in one's life, perhaps even the prioritisation of pleasure above anything else. It can and often does include different types of pleasure, from the more obvious sensory pleasures to intellectual, emotional, and spiritual pleasures. Hedonism in and of itself isn't a particularly troublesome predicament, if it is one at all, but rather, it becomes one when, as with many other predicaments, it is increased in scale and prioritised beyond proportion and balance. A life without pleasure, a condition commonly called anhedonia, is not to be desired but a life that only hunts for pleasure tends to create <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment" target="_blank">one-marshmallow</a> solutions and longer term displeasure, at least within the current cultural control systems.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>In the words of Iain McGilchrist, the natural philosopher, scientist, and author of The Matter With Things:<br>
I believe that nowadays we live no longer in the presence of the world, but rather in a re-presentation of it. The significance of that is that the left hemisphere’s task is to ‘re-present’ what first ‘presences’ to the right hemisphere. This re-presentation has all the qualities of a virtual image: an infinitely thin, immobile, fragment of a vast, seamless, living, ever-flowing whole. From a standpoint within the representation, everything is reversed. Instead of seeing what is truly present as primary, and the representation as a necessarily diminished derivative of it, we see reality as merely a special case of our representation – one in which something is added in to ‘animate’ it. In this it is like a ciné film that consists of countless static slices requiring a projector to bring it back into what at least looks to us like a living flow. On the contrary, however, reality is not an animated version of our re-presentation of it, but our re-presentation a devitalised version of reality. It is the re-presentation that is a special, wholly atypical and imaginary, case of what is truly present, as the filmstrip is of life – the re-presentation is simply what one might call the ‘limit case’ of what is real. Stepping out of this world-picture and into the world, stepping out of suspended animation and back into life, will involve inverting many of our perhaps cherished assumptions.
Iain McGilchrist, The Matter With Things
<br>McGilchrist makes the case that the major underlying dynamic behind the issues of modernity lies in the left hemisphere having become the master of the right, rather than the right being master of the left. Both hemispheres and, more generally, all facets of the human mind are vital to our survival and becoming as living beings, but when our narrow representations of reality get to rule the living world we are in deep trouble.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>There are numerous ways in which a large part of the world gets ignored or forgotten. Who has access to the internet, who is included in scientific studies, who is affected by climate change, who is seen as more or less human, who has the right to have opinions, who is seen as developed, intelligent, responsible, honest, beautiful, wise, whose existence is justified, who has a right to live, who has a right to love. What map projections we use, what poverty means, what places are important, what places need fixing, what places are colonised, what places need industrialisation. We can make sweeping statements about the global south, the third world, western and eastern world, developing countries, yet most of the "modern" world is ridiculously one-sided in its world view.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Humans are at their core mechanistic. Left to their own devices they would live in a war of all against all, completely lacking industry, culture, knowledge, art, literature, society, and instead live in a constant state of fear and danger of violent death. A solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short life. According to Thomas Hobbes that is. Humans need to be controlled through a social contract and a civil society with one sovereign authority in control of everything in order to protect them, he continues.<br>There are surely some truths to be found in Hobbes' theories of moral and political philosophy, especially with regards to a machine constructed by human beings that somehow controls them more than they control it. Nevertheless, Hobbesian views will most likely lead to the creation of the very mechanistic creatures it wants to control. How we see determines what we see.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Hyperstimuli make us crave the artificial while being disastrous for mental health and the overall development of societies with well-functioning humans. We have developed strong responses to specific stimuli based on what these stimuli tend to give us. Sugar and fat tends to be coupled with nutritious food and has historically required much work to acquire, sex tends to be coupled with intimacy and a strengthening of social bonds. Refined sugar gives us the dopaminergic response without either the nutritional reward or the required work. Pornography gives us the physical response we get from sex without the intimacy.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Identity politics has become one of the western world's biggest distraction. Interestingly, a focus on identity can bring one closer together to people and makes one's societal interconnectedness obvious. Identity in this case moves people away from individualism and towards something akin to collectivism. What makes this more of a predicament than a benefit is that while a focus on identity brings one closer to those whose identities are similar (or identical) to ones own, it moves one further away from everyone else.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>In what way is everything sacred? Well, first of all, if any one thing is sacred then through the infinite web of life everything is sacred. Do you hold your own existence to be sacred? If you do, and you truly feel the interconnectedness of everything, then you are both a part and a whole of one interconnected sacred existence, the divine. What we do will always reflect back at us, it is therefore of the highest importance to recognise the sacred nature of everything and do unto it as we would have it do unto us. The language here matters not, rather it is the fact that there are forces whose why is unclear. Life is because life is. Genetics only give an illusory explanation of the why of life. The why isn't speakable and is the basis for the divine, the underlying something of everything. Everything, you included, is a part of this something and plays a role in how this something manifests itself. If you do not understand this you do not understand the sacred. However, don't worry, the sacred is not supposed to be understood.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/collapse.png"><br>
And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.
Milton Sanford Mayer
<br>Imagine, for a moment, that we suddenly were able to manage all of the predicaments in the landscape, that we somehow solved all of our problems and helped the Earth recover. The time preceding this moment will, I believe, be seen as one of the most catastrophic collapses of life the Earth has ever seen. In just a few hundred years the Earth has gone from a beautiful, wild, and diverse place to a planet where more than 95% of mammals are cattle bred for food, pets bred for obedience, and humans pushed to compliance. The Earth is, of course, still beautiful and diverse, and has some wildness left. My argument is simply that so much has already collapsed and is already collapsing, the collapse is not some future event. The same goes for the economy, the climate, ecosystems, social welfare, spirituality, and life force in general. It is already happening, how do we control the descent, save what can be saved, and work on recovering and cultivating, fermenting, something better in the ruins?<br>The collapse is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The mystical rejects definition. However, were I to give the modern use of the word a definition I might define it as anything within or outside of science that rejects explanation and to which there doesn't seem to be a logical path. Being ignorant of the mystical therefore traps us within the strict logical boundaries of science and, slowly but surely, mystical experiences will recede from our consciousness.<br>More concretely, take an example, you are experiencing a sunset with everything that moment can include. Even if you try to explain the external event through physics and astronomy, or the internal "cogs" of your body and mind through simple chemical, mechanistic models of explanation, there is an infinity, an endlessness, in all moments of life. Even if you buy into the chemical explanation of the mind, isn't then that in itself mysterious and powerful? The alterings, inhibitions, or excitations of a few chemicals can make you love another human and protect them with your life. We must stay open towards the mystical rather than closing ourselves away from it. If we are to have any chance of living it is within the mystical we will find the path onward.<br>
The storyteller weaves the mysterious into the fabric of life, lacing it with the comic, the tragic, the obscene, making safe paths through dangerous territory.

 <br>A myth is a narrative that plays a fundamental role in a culture. The ongoing narrative is largely based on the myth of the ascent of humanity, the narrative of progress and separation. It is generally not talked about that myths control much of the underlying dynamics of our civilisation. Myths are often fictions told as vaguely historical stories that explain how, why, and what the world is, has become, and/or will end. Forget our fundamental myths and you might just confuse them with reality.<br>
Myth is promiscuous, not dogmatic. It moves like a lively river through swarthy packs of reindeer, great aristocratic families, and the wild gestures of an Iranian carpet seller. Myth is not much to do with the past, but a kind of magical present that can flood our lives when the conditions are just so. It is not just the neurosis of us humans trying to fathom our place on earth, but sometimes the earth actually speaking back to us. That's why some stories can be hard to approach, they are not necessarily formed from a human point of view.

 <br>
Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilisation.
Mahatma Gandhi
<br>People, places, cultures, thoughts, opinions, beliefs, systems, values, rights, morals, ethics, are diverse, they're different. There will never be one way of life for all to follow, neither should there be. Equality must include diversity to be of value. The only functioning way for all of humanity to be the same is having the freedom to be different, to be diverse. The next big thing will be many small things.<br>
I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.
Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina

 <br>While having coffee with a friend of mine, a PhD in economic history, he told me about a way one of his professors had explained the complexity of economics and causality. The professor asked my friend to imagine a room filled with crisscrossing ropes and trusses, creating a massive spider web of ropes in all directions. When you pulled one rope several other ropes would move in unexpected strange ways and if told to move a select few ropes in a certain way something always seemed to ruin it. Modern civilisation has remained seated in a small room with closed windows and doors, feeling competent in what to pull, completely ignorant of the fact that all ropes reach out through cracks in the walls, floor, and ceiling. Yet we sit there pulling and pulling and everything, well, everything seems great.<br>To be competent is to have the ability to do something well or efficiently. We, the people of modern civilisation, are extremely competent at believing we're competent when we're not. We are the least competent and the most helpless version of humans the earth has seen.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>GDP decoupling tends to, in general, mean the decoupling of GDP (or growth) from carbon emissions. Taking a broader view would mean decoupling GDP from any long-term detrimental externalities. Taking an even broader view could mean increasing global welfare without increasing long-term detrimental externalities and, despite the predicament's title, this is not an unreasonable goal for humanity to have for the coming years, ideally maintaining or increasing welfare while decreasing externalities. Now that is an impressive optimisation challenge if I've ever seen one.<br>
It's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.

...humans live and act in ways as fish live and act in water. We don’t notice in how many ways we depend on ways. Being in a sea of ways is being human.
Chuang Tzu
<br>The illusion of no option means a false belief that there are no other ways but the current way of doing things. So called capitalist realism is a type of illusion of no option which says that there are no functioning economic systems besides capitalism. We have no choice but to grow, extract, fight, use violence, use fossil fuels, be profitable, hire more scrum masters, enforce national borders, eat meat, use generative AI, earn money to pay rent, travel, invest, participate, and the list could go on forever. We live in a world structured by models and systems created by humans and these can, whether it appears that way or not, be changed.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Explanation is a well-dressed error.
Julio Cortázar, Hopscotch
<br>True understanding cannot be explained or boiled down to concepts or models. True understanding and the understanding of truths lies beyond the verbal and explainable and modern civilisation is, unfortunately, unknowingly, constantly conflating explanations with understanding. As a predicament, the illusion of understanding presents us with a world that never makes real sense with the explanations we have, it doesn't behave the way we expect or want. In short, everything is infinitely more complex than we can know and, since it is comforting and often useful to place the world within the frames of concepts, models, principles, and laws, we end up with an illusion of understanding the world, missing that it stretches outside of the frames, endlessly in all directions.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Justification is the act of showing something to be right or proper. Morals are principles concerning right and proper behaviour of humans in society. The paradox of modernity with its notions of progress largely stems from our uncanny ability to justify our improper actions, both to others but maybe more so to ourselves. Our justifications of moral are quite immoral. We need this immoral veneer of justifications to separate and protect us from the higher order effects of our needs and consequent actions, in order to believe that we are good people when, in reality, we might, mostly unwillingly and unknowingly, be eons away from the civilised saintliness we imagine.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Birds born in cages think that flying is a disease.

<br>Individualism emphasises the intrinsic worth of the individual, that is, the singular person. Individualism has become a predicament more because of the things it doesn't do rather than the things it does. Its focus on individual goal-achieving, self-reliance, and independence only become an issue when taken to extremes in opposition to collective welfare, community, interdependence, and broader awareness of one's belonging and contributions.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

We are definitely different from the bad people in history. The immoral fools tricked by Hitler into saluting the iron cross and casting their votes in favour of genocide, the spiritually corrupt slave traders of the colonies in Africa, the Europeans pillaging and raping (culturally and literally) the indigenous people of the "new worlds" of America, Australia, etc; the brilliant geniuses talked into developing the atom bomb, the monsters who then dropped those bombs over Japan in the name of peace. We are definitely different from them. The most efficient systematic slaughter of sentient beings the planet has ever seen, the complete indifference to the ecocide required for our day-to-day lives, the endless belief in infinite growth on a finite planet, the quantification of all that is sacred into mere resources and business opportunities, the utter carelessness toward the world our children will inherit. All this we manage to stand for in the name of progress and human kind's superiority over all others. No, we are definitely different. We are worse.
<br>Industrial slaughter is the efficient industrialised process of killing other beings. Rarely can the slaughterhouses of modernity be heard, hidden away in fields far from people, but, if you listen, you can hear them.z<br>Outgoing connections:<br>
<br><a data-href="Access to food" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/access-to-food.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Access to food</a> - Industrial slaughter funnels energy and nutrients upward in the chain, leading to a horribly inefficient way of extracting energy. True, we might not want to eat exclusively genetically modified soy beans (neither do the animals) but the conversion of arable land to food ready to be eaten in the form of meat decreases people's direct access to food.

<br><a data-href="Agriculture" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/agriculture.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Agriculture</a> - Industrial slaughter is the main driver and shaper of modern agriculture.

The taste of defeat?
<br><a data-href="Animal views" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/animal-views.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Animal views</a> - Beef, poultry, pork. Not cows, chickens, pigs. Lives become products in a machine. Hey, you, just a little business idea. Take it and run with it if you want to. Listen. Make one of those toys with buttons in the shape of chickens, cows, dogs, etc where, if you push a button, it makes the sound of the animal. But just have every click of a button emit a terrible scream for mercy. Test these toys at kindergartens and iterate your design process until you've reached perfection.
<br><a data-href="Apathy" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/apathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Apathy</a> - How does one care for lives lived in dense darkness only seen as packaged products in brightly bluelit grocery stores?

<br><a data-href="Breakdown of information infrastructure" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/breakdown-of-information-infrastructure.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Breakdown of information infrastructure</a> - Make it obligatory that slaughterhouses are built with paper thin walls as close to the city centres as possible.
<br><a data-href="Capitalism" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/capitalism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Capitalism</a> - Fat CEOs munching on the marinated ass cheeks of piglets. Ah, such dignified lives we live.
<br><a data-href="Climate change" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/climate-change.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Climate change</a> - Drastically reducing or eliminating industrial slaughter will be necessary to properly manage and/or avoid disasters following climate change.
<br><a data-href="Cognitive dissonance" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/cognitive-dissonance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive dissonance</a> - A cow is not much different from a dog. A dog is not much different from you. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful weapon against acts of love.
<br><a data-href="Dealing with death" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/dealing-with-death.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealing with death</a> - There is a longer discussion to be had regarding meat eating and dealing with death. That discussion is better had somewhere else since it doesn't apply to industrial scale killing. We must acquire the ability to internalise the deaths and suffering casued by the meat industry. To do that and not drown is difficult. Difficult but necessary. What else can we do? Where else do we think we must go?
<br><a data-href="Debt" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/debt.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Debt</a> - How could we ever begin to repay this debt?
<br><a data-href="Deforestation" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/deforestation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deforestation</a> - For example, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" target="_blank">over 70% of Brazil's deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is driven by cattle ranching</a>.

For all our power, can you see how small we are, how truly powerless we are, keeping not a grain of dignity while only destroying our own inner nature, left with sterile salt flats.
<br><a data-href="Despair" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/despair.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Despair</a> - An existence forcedly placed upon billions of rotting animal carcasses. How can I not despair? If humanity hangs, may it hang with its tippy toes just touching the ground. What sound does a human make? One of despair.
<br><a data-href="Ecological crisis" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/ecological-crisis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ecological crisis</a> - Industrial slaughter contributes to our current ecological crises in several ways. Maybe most obviously by replacing living ecosystems with monocultural factories of death.
<br><a data-href="Educational crisis" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/educational-crisis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Educational crisis</a> - Society does its best to keep the truth about slaughter away from most children. I remember visiting a farm with the purpose of learning about raising cattle for meat and milk yet I never got to take a newborn calf from its mother nor shoot it between the eyes and roast it. To be fair, I wouldn't have wanted to. But there is a massive educational chasm between knowing the truth and knowing the terror. Can we at least strive for truth?
<br><a data-href="Emotional crisis" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/emotional-crisis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emotional crisis</a> - It becomes emotionally difficult to walk around with the awareness of the incessantly ongoing systematic holocausts.
<br><a data-href="Energy consumption increasing" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/energy-consumption-increasing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Energy consumption increasing</a> - We are consuming more and ever more, and meat consumption stemming from the expansion of industrial slaughter globally, when it should decrease or fully cease, is only increasing.
<br><a data-href="Energy" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/energy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Energy</a> - Industrial slaughter and its energy-related implications clearly illustrate the inefficiency of our efficiency.
<br><a data-href="Failure to take responsibility" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/failure-to-take-responsibility.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Failure to take responsibility</a> - We must and we will be held responsible for the unnecessary suffering and deaths we've caused.
<br><a data-href="Genetic modification" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/genetic-modification.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Genetic modification</a> - We keep optimising our systems of energy extraction.

<br><a data-href="Global supply chains" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/global-supply-chains.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Global supply chains</a> - Planted salmon harvested in Norway, sent to China for processing, packaged as fish sticks in America. Glorious.
<br><a data-href="Healthcare" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/healthcare.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Healthcare</a> - What fraction of our health problems come from eating the flesh of animals in distress?
<br><a data-href="Hedonism" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/hedonism.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hedonism</a> - On the train up to Gothenburg I sat next to a group of middle-aged IT-consultants who were heading to a company team building event (yeah, I know...). For three hours all they spoke about was different kinds of beer and different kinds of meat they had consumed. Sad sedentary satires of a viking past, flattened hemorrhoids and pale hairless bellies with crusty navels. Pinnacle of modern masculinity.
<br><a data-href="Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/hemispherical-asymmetry-(brain).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)</a> - The left hemisphere sees beings as inanimate, machines, automatons. If they scream they scream because they're programmed to do so. Industrial slaughter, then, simply becomes a machine that disassembles machines to then extract those parts deemed useful to us, the most important machines.
<br><a data-href="Illusion of competence" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/illusion-of-competence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Illusion of competence</a> - I read an article the other day. It discussed some novel research in the fields of AI and organic pig farms. After ten years of analysing the sounds of the pigs through advanced AI models the researchers were surprised to learn that even on organic farms the pigs seemed quite stressed. Funny that. I wonder how many years we'd have to study Hebrew to learn that jews exterminated with organic Zyklon B would be quite stressed as well.
<br><a data-href="Illusion of no option" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/illusion-of-no-option.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Illusion of no option</a> - We have to eat a lot of meat. Just look at all of us, how fit, ripped, and healthy we all are. To keep that going I need my one chicken per day minimum.
<br><a data-href="Inequality" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/inequality.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Inequality</a> - First of all there is an inequality in terms of the value of the lives of other animals. Secondly, there is the fact that the Western diet consists of so much meat that it's impossible for the rest of the world to match it.
<br><a data-href="Insect loss" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/insect-loss.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Insect loss</a> - Industrial slaughter and its many requirements being prioritised over other factors is contributing to insect loss.

 <br>Why are institutions failing to manage our predicaments? Their existence has been made possible through many of the same mechanisms that have spawned the predicaments in the first place, meaning their only possible actions are within the dominating systems. Since the institutions must work within the boundaries of the systems they lack the ability to change the systems. As long as our institutions have obligations to serve specific economic and political interests there will not be any systemic change that allows for the effective management of our predicaments.<br>
How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?

 <br>Inequality is, clearly, the negation of equality, which means something which is equal to, or the same as, something else. Inequality is then when something isn't the same as something else. It is only when we're treated the same that we're allowed our differences.<br>The modern, highly praised version of equality is the inclusion of everyone in the eternal climb to be better than others. A woman shouldn't be at home caring for children, mending clothes and cooking, rather, she should strive for the wealth and status that enables her to give that opportunity to someone further down the ladder, how generous of her. Inequality has been solved by making everyone equally inequal in one single hierarchical structure. However, even the equality of inequality is inequal since the ladder was built by and for white male hands and, furthermore, the higher up you are the easier it is to climb. Whoops. Oh well, nothing we can do about it now! Look at the cute poor blackies down there, they look like tiny little ants, oh, one just fell, how funny, Charles, did you see that, we should get one of those, they look so lively, full of vigour, bless them.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Information can give form to thought and be part of the process of acquiring knowledge but it is, undeniably, not knowledge. The relationship between information and knowledge can be likened to the one between vision and seeing. Not all who have vision truly see. Another metaphor is that of information as bricks and knowledge as a built structure. Treating information as if it was equal to knowledge can result in an overreliance on data, bad decision-making, lack of adaptive behaviour, overconfidence, illusion of understanding, lack of a broader perception, bad predictions, false beliefs, and more. Information is also external whereas knowledge is something deeply internal and this, importantly, is what makes information so easily transferable compared to knowledge. Information is neutral whereas knowledge can come with judgement, suitable action, awareness, purpose, and understanding. Beware of the need to "stay informed" as it can often mean rejecting the time and space needed for the forming of knowledge.<br>
Nothing happened today. And if anything did, I’d rather not talk about it, because I didn’t understand it.

 <br>
Why should we tolerate a diet of weak poisons, a home in insipid surroundings, a circle of acquaintances who are not quite our enemies, the noise of motors with just enough relief to prevent insanity? Who would want to live in a world which is just not quite fatal?
Rachel Carson, Silent Spring
<br>Insects make up 90% of all animal species on Earth and are crucial parts of all ecosystems with pollinators being particularly important for the food supply for other animals and humans. Insect decline is a complex area to study and estimates on the rate of decline vary in different localities. A 2020 meta-analysis estimated a decline rate of 9% per decade for terrestrial insects but, notably, an increase in freshwater insects of 11% per decade. Most research, however, show declines in insects globally.<br>
A March 2019 statement by the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="Entomological Society of America" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America" target="_blank">Entomological Society of America</a> said there was not yet sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects and that some of the extrapolated predictions might "have been extended well past the limits of the data or have been otherwise over-hyped"
<br>I wonder what to make of the quote above. Data can always be misleading but if we are actually risking a mass extinction of insects I don't see how taking that seriously is over-hyping. If what we need before we decide to change current trends is "sufficient data" to be collected then we really are fucked.<br>
We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts.

 <br>One can know a lot and wholly lack wisdom. Some might sneer at the notion of wisdom, comparing the high seat of knowledge that modern science and reasoning is built upon with the purported "wisdom" of primitive dead peoples. Rest assured that wisdom lies above knowledge as wisdom entails the direction of action based on knowledge, experience, understanding, and insight. Knowledge tells us nothing of what to do or why. It is, rather, an awareness of certain stated facts, models, concepts, principles, or explanations. Don't get me wrong, knowledge is of the utmost importance but it is nothing without wisdom. The two should never be confused.<br>
We will not lose ourselves in the elaboration of theories or ideologies. Our words will be elemental. We write with dirt under our fingernails.

The fate of our times is characterized by rationalization and intellectualization and, above all, by the disenchantment of the world.
Max Weber
<br>The view of the world as dead, inanimate, and mechanistic is not particularly congruent with the synergistic, self-regulating, and complex nature of the world as it presents itself to our lived experience. However, this view makes it easier to justify manipulating its parts. Strapping the plow on the oxen both makes it into, and requires the oxen to be seen as, nothing but a machine. Further, if we see the world as inanimate then our actions cannot kill it because it never lived in the first place. The world is not a collection of dead static things, it is an endless ocean of living flowing streams.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

How wonderful it is that nobody needs to wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.
Anne Frank
<br>Agency is the capacity to act, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency" target="_blank">to effectively set in motion, powerfully incite action</a>. From the smallest scale of single human decisions to decisions on planetary scale, we often seem to lack agency or, at the very least, lack a belief in our agency. Agency is also, more specifically, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency" target="_blank">the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you</a>. It is, in other words, independent from the direct context and events of your situation. You can always increase your agency in some way, find how and where you're capable of action.<br>If nothing else, learning to accept situations where you experience a lack of agency can lead to an internal agency of thought that suddenly changes everything. There are no moments that completely lack agency, you just have to notice it.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Lack of balance might be one of the predicaments in the landscape that can be found in almost all other predicaments. We are out of balance in so many ways. Balance means equality of two or more masses. Figuratively, balance can also mean equality of any opposing or compared forces, objects, or processes. The more we develop, the more complex and volatile our scales become and we seem to have reached a point where the most probable path to equilibrium is an involuntary emptying of the scales.

 <br>
If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
African proverb
<br>A community is often defined as a group of people sharing common interests. Communities, especially local ones consisting of people living in the same place, have become very rare indeed. If humans are evolutionarily unfit for modernity with its speed, complexity, and scale, what, then, about our modern way of living as individuals totally lacking anything resembling community?<br>
If you have come to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.

 <br>Compassion means to suffer with someone and feel together. A lack of compassion typically results in and from the closing of eyes and ears, halting the perception of the suffering of others, being blind and deaf to the afflictions one often has contributed in creating, willingly or not. Without compassion we end up with, well, much of the world as it is today. Killing with compassion is possible, industrial slaughter is not. Compassion is, more importantly, recognising and feeling someone else's feelings and taking an active role in somehow helping the afflicted.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Wisdom, spirituality, animism, and elders have contributed historically to creating cultural control systems which, as opposed to laws, control behaviours with an open hand. Modernity mostly lacks cultural control systems since they have been replaced by game theory. When people mention the need for religion, "a new christianity", or a complete destruction of capitalism, I believe the foundational discussion that must be had is one of cultural control systems in general. A faulty control system will lead to complete lack of cultural balance, an absence of any control system whatsoever is unbounded chaos.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars. "There is the blueprint," they say.
Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities
<br>I wonder how common it is in the history of humans to feel safer at night when the stars aren't visible. Somehow, I sense an obvious issue in that the more we brighten the darkness, the more threatening the darkness becomes, as if we're condensing the beings of darkness, pushing them into the few remaining cramped corners. Unfortunately for us, the less we accept the night, embrace the darkness, the more it seeps into us, corrupts our actions and refracts our rays of thought. Beware the lack of dark spaces, it flatters you not, contorted features, darkened, deepened shadows.<br>
The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty’s ends.

 <br>Empathy is the sharing and understanding of someone else's feelings or, at the very least, an attempt. It is about relating to others through one's own experiences, picturing oneself in their position. Empathy is, if you will, the precursor to compassion. No empathy, no compassion, no compassion, no collective action to alleviate the sufferings of other beings.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
You get worse and worse. And all this talking is useless because you'll all turn to mush anyway. I'll go lay in the hammock and think. Goodbye for now in case we never see each other again.
The Muskrat (Tove Jansson), Comet in Moominland
<br>To lack faith is to lack the belief that there is any possibility of betterment, redemption, to lack trust in someone or something to make itself present. It also means lacking the confidence of what should result from certain actions. Without faith in a process of development one gets nowhere, but then again maybe finding that faith is a part of the process. In early Buddhism, faith focused on the triratna, the so called three jewels. These could, in a broader context, be seen as the faith in the good, the faith in the teachings of the good, and the community seeking to learn from that teaching. Even more generally, do you believe there is a divine good within? Do you believe this good moves us towards certain actions and views when the mind is still? Do you believe there are others with you in this? I hope there are readers who answer yes to this.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

What you do with and about this change is up to you. Modernity has, however, created the predicament that few, if any, feel needed.

 <br>Disregard history and you will slowly erase your own future. History matters greatly. History contains other ways of being, living, thinking, acting, talking, seeing, and perceiving.

However, it is equally important to learn how to think about history. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2007/what-does-it-mean-to-think-historically" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/january-2007/what-does-it-mean-to-think-historically" target="_blank">One model of historical thinking</a> provides five key concepts: change over time, causality, context, complexity, and contingency. Things change in ways we might not understand, even with hindsight, causality chains are seldom linear or simple, everything must be understood in the context of its place and time, everything is always endlessly complex, contingent events, or black swans, are improbable and inevitable at the same time.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
What is required is an attentive response to something real and other than ourselves, of which we have only inklings at first, but which comes more and more into being through our response to it – if we are truly responsive to it. We nurture it into being; or not. In this it has something of the structure of love.
Iain McGilchrist
<br>
Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real.
Iris Murdoch
<br>I feel more hesitant towards writing about this predicament than any of the others. I do not want to explain what love is, define it, pin it down. Nor do I really want to dig into the consequences of its absence. Call it what you will but everything within me senses a gravity to this predicament, a point of singularity in the landscape. The absence of love leaves us more blind than the absence of light.<br>
Love is a striking example of how little reality means to us.
Marcel Proust

Although we say mountains belong to the country, actually, they belong to those that love them.

 <br>What does it mean to have a purpose or, perhaps more importantly, to lack purpose? A purpose is an intention, aim, or goal. It is something put forth, proposed, something to be kept in view, the proper and unique reason for something's existence. Do you have a purpose? Do humans have a purpose? What about other beings? What about the sun? Whatever one answers to these questions it will shape the world one inhabits, make something of it and with it, and allow for the presence of some purposes and the absence of others. If you share humanity's lack of purpose in general, maybe there is a meta-purpose in living with the question of what the proper reason for one's own and humanity's existence could be?<br>

the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br>
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br>

Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.<br>
Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.<br>
I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br>
which is what I have been doing all day.<br>
Tell me, what else should I have done?<br>
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?<br>
Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br>

The issue which I propose for discussion should therefore be clear: how to counter the encroachment of new, electronic devices and systems upon commons that are more subtle and more intimate to our being than either grassland or roads - commons that are at least as valuable as silence. Silence, according to western and eastern tradition alike, is necessary for the emergence of persons. It is taken from us by machines that ape people. We could easily be made increasingly dependent on machines for speaking and for thinking, as we are already dependent on machines for moving.
Ivan Illich, Silence as a Commons
<br>Few, if any, places remain on our planet that aren't polluted with anthropogenic sounds. The hum of highways, airplane engines high above, tires ripping hot asphalt, titanium angels cutting clouds. The most profound wisdom lies in the depth of silence, a silence that is going extinct. Every human should have access to a place without human-made sounds, and so should every other animal. In the words of Miles Davis, "it's not the note you play that's the wrong note - it's the note you play afterwards that makes it right or wrong". The unlearning of the modern chaotic cacophony, the notes currently played, can only be made right if what follows is a silence and harmony unbounded.<br>
Always listen for what you can leave out.

 <br>Resilient systems have the ability to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/resilience" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/resilience" target="_blank">leap back</a> into equilibrium and adapt to changing conditions.<br>When systems are designed to be rigid, static, simple, and centralised they tend to lack resilience and instead collapse in a destabilising event. Many of our civilisation's systems are so interdependent that any destabilising event can create detrimental cascade effects that affect everyone. If we take the chance to redesign our systems we need to design more resilient systems that can adapt to novel situations, stay functional despite major disruptions, and allow for emergent and complex responses.<br>
Let's face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and chaotic. It is dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, not uniformity. That's what makes the world interesting, that's what makes it beautiful, and that's what makes it work.
Donella Meadows
<br>Importantly, we must also make sure that we do not become, or keep being, the disruption that ruins existing resilient systems. There are few systems resilient to the destructive capabilities of our civilisation but it is crucial that those that still exist, such as the Amazon or the atmosphere, are kept alive.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

The systems-thinking lens allows us to reclaim our intuition about whole systems and hone our abilities to understand parts, see interconnections, ask “what-if ” questions about possible future behaviors, and be creative and courageous about system redesign.

<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking" target="_blank">Systems thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts</a>. Instead of trying to find singular causes or reductionistically define overall behaviour from the behaviour of subsystems, systems thinkers tend to look at a system's dynamics, complex behaviours, feedback loops, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage_Points.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage_Points.pdf" target="_blank">leverage points</a>, etc. Systems thinking is a requirement for understanding the complex connections between predicaments and how to manage them.<br>Those who do not apply systems thinking to their decisions and actions will constantly be unpleasantly surprised by the unpredictability of their results. Oh, systems thinkers will also have unpredictable results, they're just slightly less surprised.<br>
God grant us the serenity to exercise our bounded rationality freely in the systems that are structured appropriately, the courage to restructure the systems that aren’t, and the wisdom to know the difference!

Most political terms are four years and in finance there is often talk of seven year market cycles. Most large-scale decisions fall within this range of time. It is unquestionable that we have a tendency to focus on the short-term. The seven year market cycle can be contrasted with something believed to originate in the Great Law of the Iroquois, namely the seven generation stewardship.

 <br>
In philosophy if you aren't moving at a snail's pace you aren't moving at all.
Iris Murdoch
<br>We lack time in a multitude of ways. I would, however, separate our lack of time into two categories, one being duration and the other being the prioritisation of the present moment. There is a feeling of impending doom in many people, that there isn't enough time to course correct, to halt global warming, to stop the machine before it kills us. The future is shrinking, we lack continuance of time, instead strengthening our hearts awaiting the crash with a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/duration" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/duration" target="_blank">hardened</a> future. The second category, the prioritisation of the present, is what makes the changes that are required even less likely to happen. We, as individuals, communities, societies, nations, don't have time to spend on slowing down or halting certain activities while doubling down on others. We don't have time to not be employed, grow the economy, travel, provide, we don't have time to not destroy the world. If we must spend our time destroying it, how can we even attempt to prioritise saving it at any moment?<br>Of these two categories, I would implore you to ignore the former and focus on the latter. Eternity does not lie in duration, it lies in the infinitely complex web of the moment. To find a way forward, every step of every moment has to be radical and daring.<br>
It's too late to be ready.

We cannot know his legendary head<br>
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso<br>
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,<br>
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,

the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could<br>
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs<br>

burst like a star: for here there is no place<br>
that does not see you. You must change your life.
Rainer Maria Rilke, Archaic Torso of Apollo
<br>There has occurred a narrowing of the future, a closing off. Instead of a future open with possibilities and visions of beauty, we seem resigned to the direction of our inertia. The visions that do exist seem hubristic and speaks to an ever shrinking minority of optimistic elites. Few people envision a distant future of peace, prosperity, beauty, wisdom, science, brilliance, love, community, friendship, and coherence. Is the future so dark that it denies vision? We must then withdraw from the order of events and create visions whose light comes from within, see them before they're visible.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The Potawatomi language consists of around 70% verbs compared to 30% in the English language. Why would that matter? The world of the Potawatomi is alive, being, doing, becoming. The world of English consists mostly of static things, inanimate objects. There is a lot to language, especially since the language we learn as children tends to be the language that structures and leads our thoughts for the rest of our lives. It is also nearly impossible to escape the frames of one's language in imagination and thinking processes.<br>
It is hard, today, to imagine that the word of a poet was once feared by a king.

 <br>
Laws are spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught.
Honoré de Balzac
<br>Laws are sets of rules created and enforced by social or governmental systems in order to regulate the behaviours of populations. Are laws necessary? Some argue that without laws we are nothing but lost beasts. We have plenty of laws and we still appear to be quite lost and sufficiently vicious, at least in my eyes, sometimes because of certain laws. The way governments enforce laws and tackle violence and lawless behaviour is through a monopoly on violence and lawless behaviour.<br>
I'm glad mushrooms are against the law, because I took them one time, and you know what happened to me? I laid in a field of green grass for four hours going, "My God! I love everything." Yeah, now if that isn't a hazard to our country … how are we gonna justify arms dealing when we realize that we're all one?

 <br>LGBTQ+ is one of many acronyms used to group those who are not the sexual "norm". What is the predicament in LGBTQ+? First of all, there are undoubtedly several spectra within gender and sexuality no matter what one thinks or believes. If these spectra are biological, psychological, evolutionary, pathological, cultural, or social is for other texts to explore. Secondly, the polarisation of opinions with regards to LGBTQ+ rights as an extension of human rights has become a predicament, possibly through globalisation and the intermingling of cultures with differing views on the subject but other more indirect causes could also be to blame. Transrights have become even more complicated since they tend to come with expectations for medical and surgical treatments. I currently know too little of this predicament to expand it further.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
The ultimate meaning to which all stories refer has two faces: the continuity of life, the inevitability of death.
Italo Calvino
<br>There are limits to growth in a finite system. What happens in the interaction between Earth's and humanity's systems when humanity tries to grow indefinitely?<br>Lets look at what the limits might be. The Limits to Growth report bases their model on five variables: population, food production, industrialisation, pollution, and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources. I think an even simpler way of looking at limits to growth is looking at input requirements and output management. If a set of systems requires an input of finite resources larger than the renewal of that resource it will deplete that resource. Also, if a set of systems produces waste that is larger than it can manage through reuse, recycling, or removal it will eventually cause irreversible disruption.<br>The Limits to Growth further concludes that if growth continues the most probable result is rapid, sudden, and uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity; that it is possible to alter these growth trends to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is indefinitely sustainable; and that the chances of succeeding in altering these trends increase the earlier we start striving for it. This report was written in 1972.<br>
These conclusions are so far-reaching and raise so many questions for further study that we are quite frankly overwhelmed by the enormity of the job that must be done. We hope that this book will serve to interest other people, in many fields of study and in many countries of the world, to raise the space and time horizons of their concerns, and to join us in understanding and preparing for a period of great transition&nbsp;– the transition from growth to global equilibrium.
The Limits to Growth
<br>The Limits to Growth report has been criticised from many angles and there are of course important additions such as the effect of technological development on the possibilities for further growth. The problem with the technology argument is treated in other predicaments but put simply when related to the limits to growth, we will not escape the fact that humans need resources and a way to manage its waste and we are not closer to solving this with technology now than we were during the writing of the original 1972 report.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke.
Vincent Van Gogh
<br>People of modernity are, on average, living lives of loneliness the likes of which humanity has rarely, if ever, seen before. To be alone or to be in solitude has no valence one way or the other whereas loneliness is isolation and unmet yearning, a need as deep as hunger and thirst.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Culture encompasses the social behaviours, norms, institutions, knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, capabilities, customs, individual habits, and more of groups in human societies. When most cultures fall into the same system the complexity of cultures overall will be reduced. The less cultural complexity the lower the chance that human societies can respond to societal disruptions. This loss of cultural complexity is two-sided. On one side we have a reduction in the complexity of each culture since behaviours, norms, etc must follow the requirements of the global economic systems. In other words, the cultures that exist are becoming more similar, somehow while continuing to polarise, a paradox for another time. The other side is the complete disappearing of cultures that begun with the start of colonialism which continues to this day, with people dying together with their culture.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.
Hippocrates
<br>Malnutrition is a deficiency, excess, or imbalance of energy, protein, and other vital nutrients. Malnutrition therefore includes both starvation and obesity and it is estimated that around 30% of the global population has some form of malnutrition. With our knowledge of diet and the excess of available food it is nothing less than a tragedy that we have failed completely in getting nutrition right. Rest assured that it is not simply an unfortunate coincidence or personal failings, rather it is rooted in the many underlying systems of modernity.<br>Malnutrition, away from definitions, can also include factors that are more difficult to quantify. The food we eat make up who we become and this includes the soil it grows in, the air that surrounds it, how it was cooked, who cooked it, the bacteria it contains, the way its eaten, etc. Many revolutions have been started at a dinner table.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The map is not the territory. No model or perception of reality can represent the entirety of actual reality. Importantly, the maps you use affect your view of reality. Coast lines are infinite, fractal, endless. Maps must choose a scale. Maps are abstractions of reality such as explanations, descriptions, theories, models, etc. Maps are useful and necessary to make sense of life and the world. However, using these maps require two vital points of understanding. Firstly, we must understand what the maps claim to capture. What is their focus, what has been ignored, what are the limits, which scale is chosen and why, what do the maps try to make sense of, etc. The models describing atoms and molecules can give insight into the properties of physical matter but it won't tell you how to get from Paris to Tokyo, or how to play the drums. There are other maps for that. Secondly, a map can never and will never capture all of reality. It will always be an abstraction, an approximation. If you use maps, models, theories, etc with these two points in mind, you'll stay out of most map-related trouble. Stray from these two, however, and you'll be so lost that you've left the territory.<br>
"That's another thing we've learned from your Nation," said Mein Herr, "map-making. But we've carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?"
"About six inches to the mile."
"Only six inches!" exclaimed Mein Herr. "We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!"
"Have you used it much?" I enquired.
"It has never been spread out, yet," said Mein Herr: "the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well."
Lewis Carroll, Sylvie and Bruno Concluded

<br>The maximum power principle, as a fourth law of thermodynamics, is used as a principle to quantitatively describe biological evolution as the maximum rate of useful energy transformation for any biological system.

What happens, then, when our experience of the world becomes increasingly fragmented and incoherent and our roles in the dominating stories become irrelevant or completely cut off from consequence and the flow of time? Nothing has meaning and, by extension, meaning in general does not exist for anyone or anything anywhere. The meaning crisis is, in short, a lack of meaning that stems from and results in the lack of many other aspects of modern human existence.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Whether or not one's diet should include meat is, in this case, better discussed elsewhere, though it should, in this landscape, be quite obvious where the arrows point. Nonetheless, meat consumption as an ethical, environmental, and health-related predicament is, I believe, quite clear.<br>Ethics aside, speaking the language of modernity meat consumption is so ludicrously inefficient when it comes to land use. We require a tremendous amount of land to raise livestock and the caloric extraction is increasingly more inefficient the further away from the main source we go. It is estimated that it takes around 100 times as much land to produce a kilocalorie of beef versus the equivalent plant-based alternative and, before you speak, the same is true for a gram of protein. Is modernity really obsessed with efficiency and intelligent solutions?<br>I will also add that there are certain arguments claiming we should eat meat that I find attractive but unconvincing. They always sound something like "to truly be part of life, we must also be part of death, and to keep the world and ourselves healthy we must live side by side with grazing animals... and eat them in their prime". Okay, I slightly modified the last bit but you get the gist of it. Death is undoubtedly a part of life and everything we do in and for life has its mirrored acts in and for death. But if I lived in a community that argued that we needed to live side by side with other people who were then harvested for organs, blood, and meat in their prime... Well, I think I'd go live somewhere else. The poetic argument that there is beauty in the fact that the cow you eat contains the life force of everything it ate living off the land sounds to me like an attempt to dress one's desire for beef in poetic justification. After all, compared to every other animal on Earth humans have the ability to adapt their ways of living almost indefinitely. Why not pick a way of peace?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

<br>We, as humans, have not evolved for the ways of living modernity offers. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health" target="_blank">Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing cognition, perception, and behaviour</a>. Mental illness is therefore any long-term negatively affecting emotional or psychological condition which affects cognition, perception, behaviour, and overall well-being. Many mental illnesses are direct adaptations to the life of modernity, ways of managing the dissonance of a life with several needs and wants forever unmet, where some management methods end up being coincidentally beneficial and some crippling. I would even go so far as to say that those who are perfectly mentally healthy in the modern world are more worrying than those who aren't and I would, consequently, quite confidently, say that the cognition, perception, and behaviour required to be truly happy while balls-deep in modernity is the real illness.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Microplastics are small fragments of any type of plastic (&lt;5 mm). Unless they are designed to be biodegradable they tend to accumulate in the environment, particularly in water but also the air and soil. They are mobile, persistent, and difficult to remove from nature. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/microplastics-from-textiles-towards-a" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/microplastics-from-textiles-towards-a" target="_blank">Over 80% of the microplastic in the environment comes from textiles, tires, and city dust</a>. The environmental and health impacts of microplastics are uncertain but it isn't unreasonable to think that an accumulation of synthetic non-degradable material in all living organisms could end up being catastrophic.<br>
Although man’s record as a steward of the natural resources of the earth has been a discouraging one, there has long been a certain comfort in the belief that the sea, at least, was inviolate, beyond man’s ability to change and to despoil. But this belief, unfortunately, has proved to be naïve.

 <br>Let me begin with a left-brained approach to illustrating how at fault we are when we assume ourselves to be minds or brains living in a casing of flesh. The brain consists of neurons and the amount of neurons seem to correlate quite well with an animal's intelligence, in a way. Our gut has more neurons than the brain of a dog. How, then, are your thoughts separated from your "gut feelings"?<br>I have difficulty even entertaining the thought for longer than I already have in this example. There is no boundary, no separation, between mind and body. Even talking about mind and body as separate things shows my own inclination towards distinction. Your body is your mind, your mind is your body, you are both, your mind together with your body is your connection to the world which you are also. Take that and run with it or do what you will.<br>We inevitably create difficulties for ourselves when we see mind and body as separate and it is, frankly, ridiculous of a supposedly intelligent being to hold such delusions.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>It is not unreasonable to make the case that there has never in the history of the Earth existed a more prolonged and systematic creation of suffering than the current mistreatment of animals, specifically animals used in the production of food. Those humans who manage to climb out of the collapsed rubble of modernity will surely see our mistreatment of animals as the biggest moral crime in all of history, the most terrible nightmare, the darkest and most evil of industrial demons, the thorn in the belief in the good of their own species.<br>About a million cows are slaughtered every day, around 3 million goats and sheep, close to 4 million pigs, 12 million ducks, and hundreds of millions of fish. 140,000 chickens are slaughtered each minute. If you believe animals suffer at all, even just the tiniest amount, the moral scale of these actions is immense beyond imagining.<br>I can sometimes find certain justifications believable, especially when actions have very complex impacts that aren't directly obvious. Any justification for the efficient incessant holocaust machinery that our meat consumption requires is simply ridiculous.<br>We shouldn't, of course, forget the impact humans have on wild animals, or maybe it would be more accurate to say the impact it has had on wild animals, since there are very few left. Since the rise of humans around a hundred thousand years ago there has been an 85% decline in terrestrial wild mammal biomass and we can now quite confidently claim that we are living through an anthropogenic extinction event. 4% of the Earth's mammals are wild and we're working on getting them extinct, 34% percent are humans, the remaining 62% are our pets or live short lives in factories of death.

A fool sees himself as another, but a wise man sees others as himself.
Dogen Zenji
<br>Quite an obvious one, is it not? Although, I would claim that as a predicament this one points to two separate mistreatments of other humans. One is the deliberate and intentional mistreatment of humans, unrelated to what motivates said mistreatment. Killing, raping, enslaving, abusing, isolating, marginalising, excluding, etc. The other, more fickle, all-encompassing, and hidden is the global systemic mistreatment of other humans somehow unfit for the life of modernity. There exist no righteous, reasonable, or even acceptable motivations for the mistreatment of those who stand in the way of the stampede of modernity and, sadly, the more crippled, blind, and injured modernity becomes the less it cares about what it tramples as it moves ahead.<br>The main issue with this predicament is that most of us don't recognise or acknowledge our complicity in the mistreatment of other humans. Why should we? Aren't we enlightened and good people? Well, no, it might be true for christmas presents but for most actions it is not the thought that counts.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceased to be a man.
Frederick Douglass
<br>It is estimated that there are about 50 million people living in conditions of modern slavery. Modern slavery is, according to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/#the-scale" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/#the-scale" target="_blank">Walk Free</a>, "situations of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception". I would, with this definition in mind, potentially increase their estimate quite a bit but let it be enough to say that slavery is not a thing of the past, it might even be at its historical peak.<br>
Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves.

<br><a data-href="Biased evidence selection" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/biased-evidence-selection.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Biased evidence selection</a> - Modern slavery must be constantly justified by the few metrics we've deemed as unquestionable good.

 <br>Agricultural monocultures, or the practice of monocropping, means growing the same crop on the same land year after year. The main reasons for monocropping is the potential overall profitability, productivity, and efficiency. Another important reason for monocropping is predictability. When timber came from planted rows of trees instead of complex forests it became much easier to calculate current and future yields. Like many other predicaments agricultural monocultures provide potential short-term benefits while likely resulting in long-term cascades of problems.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Multipolar traps are some of the most prevalent generator functions of existential risks and one of, if not the most difficult challenge humankind has ever faced. But what are multipolar traps? They are game theory power plays. One way to look at multipolar traps is as a variation on the tragedy of the commons, where different entities compete over a resource and through their own self-interest deplete the resource for themselves and everyone else. The reason for this happening is that if there is enough resources around for everyone it only requires one entity being slightly greedy for everyone else to be incentivised to do the same in order to ensure their own survival. So, since our entity is "good" we should, before all this happens, trust in our understanding of game theory and extract as much of that resource as we can so we can ensure that the other entities don't do it first. It was simply the right thing to do. Game theory-wise, and tragedy of the commons-wise. Raise this behaviour up a notch and include exponential power and technology and you have multipolar traps.<br>I don't believe a single person in the world feels stoked about the existence of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ejROOyHW0" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6ejROOyHW0" target="_blank">AI-controlled nuclear drones, yet every major military power is developing them as fast as they possibly can</a>. We are stuck in a race to become the one entity that survives. And now, since this race requires different types of vital resources, has become global, and is driven by such power, we might slowly come to realise, I hope, that what we are racing towards is to become the first entity to destroy everything. If we do not figure out how to solve multipolar traps, acquire the wisdom to manage them, these traps will guarantee the complete collapse of civilisation and the extinction of most life on Earth.<br>Many of the negative cascade effects that can arise out of the connections in the Predicament Landscape are multipolar traps and it is therefore of the highest importance to develop an understanding for both the interconnectedness and interdependence of different predicaments.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The current dominating mainstream narrative of humanity is a narrative of progress. Specifically, it tends to relate to technological innovation as a fundamental driver of history.

What does it mean to be naive in ones view of progress as opposed to having an intelligent and wise view of progress? And why does this narrative matter?<br>In the naïveté there hides several problems of scale or span, both in time and space.

 <br>Techno-optimists tend to believe that all problems can be solved by new technology, including the problems created by previous technologies, given enough time. Everything is an engineering problem requiring the proper technological fix. This tends to be coupled with the view that technological innovation is created by private enterprise and funded through capitalist means. This coupling is important due to the fact that technology isn't value neutral and will follow the values of its investors and believers.<br>

 <br>News is information about current events. Since news sources compete with each other for readers they must try to maximise the amount of readers and the retention of those readers as regular readers. This leads to sensationalist media with a focus on war, sex, money, celebrity gossip, or anything else that triggers instinctive responses in its readers, often leaning towards negative emotions such as anger. News also acts as the main actor in manipulation of thoughts, behaviours, and opinions of people and what the news chooses to report on forms people's concerns.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
Those are my enemies: they want to overthrow and to construct nothing themselves. They say: "All that is worthless"--and want to create no value themselves.
Friedrich Nietzsche
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" target="_blank">Nihilism is a set of philosophical views that rejects certain aspects of human existence, such as knowledge, morality, or meaning</a>. Life is meaningless, there is nothing such as knowledge and wisdom, everything is pointless, worthless, and without value. Nihilism, etymologically, simply means nothingness. There is, therefore, nothing behind, within, or underneath it all. The world, existence, consciousness, the soul, all is one big nothingness. In some ways I can agree with nihilists that underneath all of everything there is no-thingness. There is something else. Nihilists believe in nothing and have nothing to lose, see nothing in values, ethics, or the continued existence of the world, or even that their actions have any effect on anything that matters.<br>
The man of the future who will redeem us not only from the hitherto reigning ideal but also from that which was bound to grow out of it, the great nausea, the will to nothingness, nihilism; this bell stroke of noon and of the great decision that liberates the will again and restores its goal to the earth and his hope to man; this Antichrist and anti-nihilist; this victor over God and nothingness - he must come one day.
Friedrich Nietzsche

 <br>Technological development today mostly lacks the so-called precautionary principle. The precautionary principle states that when developing something one must first work to ensure that its coming into being will not be catastrophically threatening, and only build it when one is confident about this. Modern technological development goes by the opposite principle. If there isn't definite proof that something is catastrophically threatening one can develop and build anything. There is no possibility for hindsight after the development of catastrophically threatening technologies.<br>

 <br>Many indigenous peoples have (or had) existed for a nearly unimaginably long time, often in harmony with their surroundings and living fairly peaceful lives, especially when considering peace and violence in a broader sense. There are, of course, exceptions. Most indigenous wisdom will appear quite foreign and nonsensical to most westerners, both less and more abstract, less and more real. The strangeness of their wisdom and the exceptions where violence and brutishness was the norm has nearly led to an extinction of indigenous wisdom traditions and a complete lack of respect for it.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>To maintain is to keep something in its proper condition and, maybe more importantly, an expression of love for material and immaterial objects requiring care, time, and work.<br>Alex Vuocolo writes in an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/" target="_blank">article</a> on the disappearing art of maintenance that it "distinguishes itself rhetorically from sustainability. Sustainability is a state; maintenance is a process. It requires work, and work of a certain type. Whatever its ultimate goal — safety, material efficiency, reducing carbon emissions — practical know-how and repetitive labor come first. This kind of pragmatism is sorely needed in the climate debate, which is so often preoccupied with end-states that it has no earthly or humanly way of achieving."<br>Maintenance might be one of the most important but undervalued types of work.<br>
The real people who hold our civilization together are the maintenance people. If it weren't for them - pumping water out of subways, painting bridges to keep from rusting, fixing a steam pipe that is 70 years old - we'd be sunk. If we got rid of all the politicians and the policymakers in the world, the world would keep going. If you get rid of maintenance people, the whole thing breaks down.

 <br>We used to live in small self-sufficient communities that held life together with a firm but open hand. Food, medicine, clean water, nature, family, friends, elders, children, social gatherings, craftsmen, artists, builders, makers, all were contained locally in one place. Sure, food production is more efficient, allegedly, if centralised, medical practices are better off, allegedly, when put into massive hospital structures, more clean water can be... etc etc. I might sometimes, rightfully, be blamed for wearing rose-tinted glasses when looking at the past. However, I am simply attempting to look past through the drug-infused haze of modernity.

 <br>In Europe, the UK, and the US between 25 and 38% of the population is obese. This is utterly stupid and the fact that we seem unable to positively affect this goes to show, if nothing else, how indifferent our welfare systems are to welfare. Obesity, in the case of the percentages above, is defined as having a BMI of over 30. BMI can be a problematic index but it tends to work quite well on large populations. If instead of looking only at obesity we include overweight (BMI &gt; 25) we find, for the same regions, that more than 60% of the population is overweight or obese.

The ocean turns sour. As we continue to annoy the ocean and destabilise it we are risking disrupting all life it contains and supports. To be blunt, this includes us and everything else. Don't piss off the ocean.<br>
It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.

 <br>
Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult.
C.S. Lewis
<br>It is sometimes said that modern nations have two governmental options: chaos or oppression. As clear examples, China has chosen oppression and USA has chosen chaos. Of course, there are other alternatives in the spectrum between those options and the one always includes the other.<br>The global economy, social media, and most societies are working under some sort of oppressive system for the good of its people. You are free as long as you stay within the boundaries of the systems you inhabit and, if the systems fail to convince you that they're for your own good, you will have to tackle the fact that they have a monopoly on violence and either force you back into freedom or fully out of it.

Ån är översvämmad<br>
Ängens alla strån följer nu vattnets dans<br>
Som hästens man följer luftens<br>
Eftertänksamt glider änder fram på ytan<br>
De knotiga pilträden dricker djupt och sträcker sina kala grenar<br>
Högt upp i det fortfarande snöbleka täcket<br>
Nästan snuddandes vid gladans fingerspetsar<br>
Någonstans har cykelpumpen redan börjat fylla januari med vår<br>
Nästan ljudlöst forsar ån ivrigt under bron<br>
Bottens alla stenar blundar och vilar för en stund<br>
Titta på mig<br>
Jag ser att du blivit äldre<br>

 <br>Civilisation stands upon a foundation of technologies, but we must be wary of mistaking the technological foundation for the ground, especially when the technology is developed and managed by, as is often the case, corporations or profit-seeking entities. The technological foundations of our civilisation contain many technologies that are bound together with other predicaments in this landscape leading to a lack of resilience, increasing the risk for societal collapse in a globally affecting event. This is especially the case with technologies used for basic needs such as heating, food production, water and sewage treatment, and electricity.

This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.

<br>A pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that quickly spreads across a large region. Many aspects of modern civilisation make pandemics more likely, more globally affecting, and potentially more deadly. If something similar to the Spanish flu was to spread globally today there could be approximately 240 million deaths (looking at a 3% crude mortality rate) compared with the estimated deaths from COVID-19 at around <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid" target="_blank">19 to 36 million</a>.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Parenting, especially good parenting, has, in many ways, never been as difficult as it is today. It takes a village to raise a child, it is said, and withstanding the lack of village-sized communities, parents barely have the time or energy to raise their children. It seems that in order to be a good parent, whatever that might mean, one must choose to fail in the areas modern society values most such as individual goals and achievements, freedom of time, career success, productivity, financial wealth, social status, etc. To be a stay-at-home parent seems to mean one has chosen individualist suicide in service of others, oh the shame.<br>If you disagree with everything written in this predicament landscape, can you at least recognise that the way society discourages the proper caring of children (just look at the salary of kindergarten teachers) is plainly, utterly, completely, terrifyingly stupid? And if society justifies fucking up the raising of new humans, what the fuck do we think will happen?<br>
A baby's cry is precisely as serious as it sounds.

The world has changed.<br>
I see it in the water.<br>
I feel it in the Earth.<br>
I smell it in the air.<br>
Much that once was is lost,<br>
For none now live who remember it.
Galadriel (J.R.R. Tolkien), The Lord of the Rings
<br>We might, with full understanding of our actions, willingly, have poisoned the water, the earth, and the air to the extent that it might never again be the same. Even the consequences of the most benevolent large-scale actions might pale in comparison with the life span of certain anthropogenic chemicals, fossils of our stupidity, more common than grains of sand in the empty desert of the potential future we mustn't choose. Can we become healers utilising the same genius that created the poisons to instead spread cures?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow
<br>Polarisation means divergence from the centre towards the end of an axis. In politics this tends to mean that groups move towards opposing ideological extremes, right and left extremism, but polarisation can mean any separation, segregation, or divergence of groups from a joint centre to opposing extremes.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/middle_class.png"><br>As populations and the economy grows we see more and more people entering what is known as the middle class, the middle of the global social hierarchy. This hierarchy is most commonly based on occupation, income, education, and/or social status and the middle class is sometimes more specifically defined as, for example, the point where people have roughly a third of their income left after paying for basic needs. Another definition sometimes seen is the point where people can afford vacation and travel. Increase in available energy has led to population growth and populations entering the middle class further increases the energy required by the existing population. There is also a deeper conversation to be had regarding what the middle class even means and if the notion of "lifting" people out of poverty hides and neglects the underlying problem. A process of modernity concealing the underlying problem? Surely not?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Poverty is the state of one who lacks the financial or material resources to satisfy their basic, essential, normal, or socially required needs. Poverty is therefore relative to its surroundings. Predicament-wise, poverty generally refers to the poorest in the world who are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty" target="_blank">often undernourished, without access to basic services and water, who have less access to education, and suffer from much poorer health</a>. There are few, if any, places left in the world not participating in the global economy which leads to money and, more specifically, income to act as the main proxy for poverty.<br>The international extreme poverty line is currently set at 2.15 USD per day but with poverty being relative we see national poverty rates of 2.04 USD for Ethiopia and 24.55 USD for the United States. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief" target="_blank">The $2.15 poverty line, set by the UN, shows that globally close to one in ten people live in extreme poverty</a> whereas if we look at high-income countries with a poverty line of around 30 USD around 84% of the world population could be considered (relatively) poor.<br>Important to note is that a proxy is only a proxy. A nation can increase its average household income above the poverty line while the quality of life decreases. I would argue that the problem with global poverty rates is that it exists at all at the same time as there are obese people, overly wealthy people, miserable people who throw away food and have several cars. There is enough for everyone, at least for the time being, and if we are unable to allow one of the poorest countries, Ethiopia, to even afford to drink the coffee they've grown themselves... Well, then something has to change on a deeper level.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

I loved when Bush came out and said, 'We are losing the war against drugs.'
You know what that implies? There's a war being fought, and the people on drugs are winning it.
Bill Hicks
<br>For an entity to maintain its existence it is vital that, if power is to concentrate, it concentrates in those groups that have the entity's best in mind. The game theory of capitalism where the only way to not lose power is to win it and keep it, increasing one's optionality and agency while the rest of the entity's options are narrowed. More concretely, people with power and money can do anything as long as they keep that power whereas the majority of the entity fall into a treadmill of working to ensure the maintenance of the higher group's power and financial increase.<br>If one was to design a system that made sure the worst people climbed to the top, it would be something very close to what we've ended up with. It is vital that we either change some characteristics of our global economic system to ensure the right people are in power or change the hierarchical structure of the system to allow for more decentralised power structures.<br>

 <br>Propaganda is a way of propagating an agenda through persuading and influencing an audience's emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions. Propaganda takes many forms, some obvious and explicit such as social media manipulation and political campaigns, others hidden and deeply ingrained in education, cultures, news, narratives, science, and religion.

Assumptions or opinions are like computer programs in people’s minds. Those programs take over against the best of intentions — they produce their own intentions.

 <br>Public transport is a transport system available for use by the general public. There are a few things that are necessary for a nation to claim to have a social welfare system. Public transport is one of these things. Public transport most commonly consists of trains, trams, buses, and ferries. Compared with other modes of transport public transport is generally regarded as significantly more energy efficient, it has the ability to move more people, it is cheaper for the passengers than vehicle ownership, and it reduces the overall amount of travelling vehicles. Downsides to public transport is a lack of transportation freedom as well as a difficulty transporting goods. There is freedom in being able to drive wherever and whenever you want with the car fully loaded with groceries that you drop off outside your door. An important consideration here, however, is that designing a city for private transport leads to people needing cars whereas designing for public transport leads to people not needing cars.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
To seek the timeless way we must first know the quality without a name. There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.
Christopher Alexander
<br>Quality is a property of something. The pragmatic interpretation is the superiority of something. I believe quality is more or less undefinable and is, rather, something felt. I also believe quality as a noun is problematic since an object shows its superior quality through a mode of being or through an aspect of its existence. Things of quality tend to last longer, last differently, feel full of intention, exist more purely. Quality is usually talked about in opposition to quantity and is, in general, seen as the opposing dial in a production process. Increase the quantity and you must decrease the quality and vice versa. Because of quality's undefinable quality and our modern time's obsession with measuring and quantification, quality has in many cases been pushed to the sidelines. If we cannot measure it we cannot understand it, we might claim. Yet, I believe we most likely have a superior intuition about quality than we do about quantity. Never mind how many jelly beans the jar contains, would you say the jar is of a good quality?<br>Quality is also related to the virtues of the divine and therefore tends to be kept in the realms of the religious. With religion and spirituality having a miniscule part in modern life there are few reasons to seek the improvement of one's qualities.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Quantification is the act of mapping observations into quantities, numbers. It is necessary for the use of mathematics and statistics as fundamental paths to scientific truth and is often the main arguments behind claims of objectivity. Quantification is important but becomes a predicament when relied upon as superior to all other methods of finding truth, especially when quantification is used in fields that lack well defined quantitative proxies such as in the social sciences. In this landscape, as with many other predicaments, quantification has become a hammer turning everything into nails.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know.
James Baldwin
<br>Racism is the discrimination of people based on their "race", appearance, ethnicity, or other, commonly visual and place-related, characteristics. It is also one of the more prevalent shortcuts to passing blame and striving for betterment. If they simply went away we'd be better off. Racism easily takes hold of ancient instincts to oppose strangers and be weary of people who appear different. This makes racism a suitable driving force for many political agendas, propaganda, and directing the rage of a people towards a common (non-)enemy.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Rationalism is the epistemological view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive. Rationalism and its main principles of logic, mathematics, and metaphysics are important tools for thinking but exclusive reliance on rational thinking risks the thinker ending up in a world of representation whose bonds with present reality are silently cut. The main method of ensuring the representations are grounded in reality is through science and quantification/mathematics which, as other predicaments detail, leads one to bias ones thinking towards what is quantifiable while having difficulty factoring in what isn't. It is important to note that rationalism in and of itself is not problematic. A lack of balance and an exclusive focus on rationalism as the be all and end all of the thinking process is what makes it into a current predicament. And remember, rationalisation is not rational. Rationalisation is having a conclusion and backfilling why that is the correct conclusion. Rationality should systematically do the opposite.<br>
Perhaps there is more sense in our nonsense and more nonsense in our 'sense' than we would care to believe.

 <br>Reductionism describes the behaviour of systems in terms of the systems' parts. Another way of looking at it is that reductionism attempts a bottom-up approach to understanding, for example trying to describe minds through the interactions of neurons, as opposed to holism which attempts to understand the system as a whole apart from the properties of its component parts. Reductionism is so deeply ingrained into our way of thinking in the modern world that we often mistake its mechanistic explanations for true understanding, leading to our incredible ability to manipulate the very building blocks of the universe with complete ignorance of why undesirable behaviour <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergentism" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergentism" target="_blank">emerges</a>.<br>

 <br>As living beings there is no getting around the fact that we need resources for our continued survival. In many ways, the acquiring of resources and the management of waste is what defines a well-adapted living organism. Unfortunately, we're currently extracting and using resources in ways that don't give them time to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/resource" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/resource" target="_blank">rise again</a>, leading to resource depletion.<br>There are several types of resources and these include, just to name a few, fossil fuels, minerals, metals, animals, water, humans, computing resources, air, and plants. Finding and employing the suitable methods of extraction and utilisation of these resources in sustainable amounts is crucial for our survival.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
He woke once more to external reality, looked round him, knew what he saw - knew it, with a sinking sense of horror and disgust, for the recurrent delirium of his days and nights, the nightmare of swarming indistinguishable sameness.
Aldous Huxley, Brave New World
<br>Nearly everything has been sucked into the global system of modernity. This global system has immense clarity in its optimisation, however questionable that optimisation is. To remain in the global system, which isn't truly a choice, one must then optimise according to that same formula. Utilising the same data and the same optimisations then leads one to more or less the same conclusions that every other entity in the system has reached, and a race to fully realise that optimisation ensues. In the blink of an eye the manifestations of human minds all look the same, asymptotically approaching the optimal solution to the question of how to grow and win. Buildings, vehicles, food, products of technology, graphic design, media. We all have the freedom to be different as long as we follow the formulae which keeps us the same.<br>For the future to be anything different than the present, a diversity near extinction must be resuscitated and allowed to flourish, variety and difference allowed to emerge, and the sameness of individualism organically replaced with cultural complexity.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Selfishness is the exclusive regard to one's own interest and happiness. Selfishness is not particularly discouraged in modernity, quite the opposite, sometimes it is even regarded as the virtuous root of human nature and consequently the cause of social progress. In a way, capitalism capitalises on humans selfishness in order to create more wealth for others to succeed in being selfish. Tens of thousands of years of wisdom pointing to selfishness as one of, if not the main struggle of human life, and yet here we are wondering why things aren't going the way we hoped...<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
It is quite usual for us to gather pieces of information from various sources, thinking in this way to increase our knowledge. Actually, following this way we end up not knowing anything at all... Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.
Shunryu Suzuki
<br>
The real existential risk is a loss of the ability to make sense of the world around us: what is worth doing, and what the likely effects of things will be.
Daniel Schmachtenberger
<br>In the words of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/" target="_blank">The Consilience Project</a>,<br>
Changes in science, media, and the nature of our basic social structures (such as economics, politics, and warfare) have been building in complexity at an accelerating rate. Our ability to make sense of things can no longer keep pace. This is a situation in which effective innovations are needed that can upgrade our capacities for learning, fast. We have little choice but to learn new ways to make sense of the world together, in a new kind of public sphere. This new approach to sensemaking is needed to address an increasing number of consequential decisions facing our governments, communities, and families.
...Without a shared ability to make sense of the world as a means to inform our choices, we are left with only the game of power.
<br>What, then, is sense-making? It is, I believe, significant that the etymological roots of the word sense are way and journey. The predicament landscape is one way of trying to manage the sense-making crisis and, figuratively, it's attempting to do this by finding ways and paths in the predicament landscape and, consequently, hopefully, ways forward for us and our world. Sense-making, in other words, is creating a viable way in and through the complex nature of existence with our present predicaments.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Sexism is the discrimination of someone based on their sex or gender. Sexism comes in many forms, some of which are accepted and barely recognised and some of which are seen as clearly wrong in every aspect. Both the milder and the stronger forms of sexism have their origins in deeply conditioned beliefs that put clear valence on male versus female attributes and characteristics.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>How do we make sense of the world? We generally do it through developing models that act as simplifications of the world. This is necessary and useful. It is not unlikely that this model-making and ability for recursive abstraction is what makes the human mind different from other minds. The simplified models allow us to form an understanding of how an animal functions and moves while recursive abstraction allows us to go from the understanding that biting can penetrate the animal's skin to an insight into teeth, force, sharpness, and furthermore the development of the bow and arrow.<br>The problem arises when we start overrelying on simplifications and models to the extent that we fail to make sense of the complexity of the world. It is sometimes said that if you can't explain something simply you do not understand it. I would counter that with perhaps the controversial view that if you truly and deeply understand something you might not be able to explain it at all.<br>The world and everything in it is infinitely complex and simplifications serve as good models. However, when we accept these simplifications as accurate depictions of the world we lose our ability to act when the world acts in ways the models didn't predict. If we keep our simplified world view the risk is that the world starts <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/about" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/about" target="_blank">simplifying us</a>.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Only that which can change can continue.
James Carse, Finite &amp; Infinite Games
<br>We are moving so fast and changing what must change so slowly. If at all. We seem stuck, like a toddler repeating the same joke not understanding why we're no longer laughing. There is so much we have to do, so much we should've already done, yet the incentives are misaligned, misdirected, all wrong. Do you see it? It isn't even that difficult, it would just require everyone, or most of us, maybe not even that, maybe just a few more, for a critical mass to be reached and for a phase shift to occur, like a chicken breaking out of its egg, realising the world is so much more than it thought, so much more than thought.

Social media does, of course, have its positives, but I would argue many of its positives have become necessities because of the world social media has created.

 <br>Soil erosion is the wearing away of the upper layer of soil. This thin layer of dust on the crusty surface of a billiard ball is what supports all life. Without it nothing can grow or live.<br>We are <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.etymonline.com/word/erosion" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/erosion" target="_blank">gnawing away</a> at the topsoil of the Earth with increasing speed and ferocity, consuming what isn't ours.<br>
It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.
Gandalf (J.R.R. Tolkien), Lord of the Rings
<br>Soil erosion has several causes, some (or presently most) which are affected or generated by human activities. These include agricultural practices such as tillage, monocropping, pesticide use, and chemical fertilizers; deforestation, roads and cities, as well as climate change more generally.<br>
For many years, my walks have taken me down an old fencerow in a wooded hollow on what was once my grandfather’s farm. A battered galvanized bucket is hanging on a fence post near the head of the hollow, and I never go by it without stopping to look inside. For what is going on in that bucket is the most momentous thing I know, the greatest miracle that I have ever heard of: it is making earth.
The old bucket has hung there through many autumns, and leaves have fallen around it and some have fallen into it. Rain and snow have fallen into it, and the fallen leaves have held the moisture and so have rotted. Nuts have fallen into it, or been carried into it by squirrels; mice and squirrels have eaten the meat of the nuts and left the shells; they and other animals have left their droppings; insects have flown into the bucket and died and decayed; birds have scratched in it and left their droppings and perhaps a feather or two. This slow work of growth and death, gravity and decay, which is the chief work of the world, has by now produced in the bottom of the bucket several inches of black soil…The old bucket started out a far better one than you can buy now. I think it has been hanging on that post for something like fifty years.
If the local culture cannot preserve and improve the local soil, then, as both reason and history inform us, the local community will decay and perish, and the work of soil building will be resumed by nature. A human community, then, if it is to last long, must exert a sort of centripetal force, holding local soil and local memory in place. Practically speaking, human society has no work more important than this.

 <br>
Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem.
Joseph Stalin
<br>Solutionism generally views all problems as engineering or technology problems, that all problems can be solved through a technological fix. The problems solutionism tends to solve are generally caused by the technological fixes that were used to solve the previous problem. With solutionism's basis being the reductionistic and mechanistic view of the world, what tends to happen is that each solution brings unforeseen externalities that require further solving. The way solutionism expresses itself today, often as a "kicking the bucket" situation, is one of the main reasons why I've decided on discussing predicaments rather than problems. There will be no solutions or technological fixes for this landscape.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/solutionism.png"><br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>What is spirituality to you? Is it an image of an Indian ascetic rigidly meditating in scorching heat? Is it candles scented with Gwyneth Paltrow's vagina? Whatever it is for you, it is in a state of crisis and this crisis is one of the most widely affecting underlying dynamics of the predicament landscape.<br>Spiritual practices tend to give the answers to the questions we no longer dare to ask, or maybe it is more accurate to say that spirituality creates the space to live those questions. Why? What for? Who are we? Why are we here? What is life? What does it mean to be conscious, to breathe, to feel, to see, to know, to love, to die?<br>A spiritual crisis is commonly defined as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_crisis" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_crisis" target="_blank">a form of identity crisis where an individual experiences drastic changes to their meaning system</a>, and I would argue that the spiritual metacrisis of our time is the disintegration of all meaning systems.<br>
...where there are machines, there are bound to be machine worries; where there are machine worries, there are bound to be machine hearts. With a machine heart in your breast, you've spoiled what was pure and simple; and without the pure and simple, the life of the spirit knows no rest.

For many generations…they obeyed the laws and loved the divine to which they were akin…they reckoned that qualities of character were far more important than their present prosperity. So they bore the burden of their wealth and possessions lightly, and did not let their high standard of living intoxicate them or make them lose their self-control…
But when the divine element in them became weakened…and their human traits became predominant, they ceased to be able to carry their prosperity with moderation.

 <br>I was introduced to the story of separation through the work of Charles Eisenstein. In <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/eng/separation/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/eng/separation/" target="_blank">his words</a>:<br>
Who are you? You are a separate individual among other separate individuals in a universe that is separate from you as well. You are a Cartesian mote of consciousness looking out through the eyes of a flesh robot, programmed by its genes to maximize reproductive self-interest. You are a bubble of psychology, a mind (whether brain-based or not) separate from other minds and separate from matter. Or you are a soul encased in flesh, separate from the world and separate from other souls. Or you are a mass, a conglomeration of particles operating according to the impersonal forces of physics.
...
Who are we as a people? We are a special kind of animal, the apex of evolution, possessing brains that allow the cultural as well as the genetic transfer of information. We are unique in having (in the religious view) a soul or (in the scientific view) a rational mind. In our mechanical universe we alone possess consciousness and the wherewithal to mold the world according to our design. The only limit to our ability to do so is that amount of force we can harness and the precision with which we can apply it. The more we are able to do so, the better off we are in this indifferent or hostile universe, the more comfortable and secure.
...
Where have we come from and where are we going? We started out as naked, ignorant animals, barely hanging on to survival, living lives that were nasty, brutish, and short. Fortunately, thanks to our big brains, science replaced superstition and technology replaced ritual. We ascended to become the lords and possessors of nature, domesticating plants and animals, harnessing natural forces, conquering diseases, laying bare the deepest secrets of the universe. Our destiny is to complete that conquest: to free ourselves from labor, from disease, from death itself, to ascend to the stars and leave nature behind altogether.
...
...The answers to these questions are culturally dependent, yet they immerse us so completely that we have seen them as reality itself. These answers are changing today, along with everything built atop them—which basically means our entire civilization. That is why we sometimes get the vertiginous feeling that the whole world is falling apart. Seeing the emptiness of what once seemed so real, practical, and enduring, we stand as if at an abyss. What’s next? Who am I? What’s important? What is the purpose of my life? How can I be an effective agent of healing? The old answers are fading as the Story of the People that once answered them crumbles around us.
<br>In short then, the story of separation is, or was(?), the dominating narrative of humanity. You are separate from other humans, humans are separate from other animals, the world consists of separate things, we must continue along the axis of progress and mould these separate things for the continued domination of and further separation from the primitiveness of lesser beings. Separation might be the most fundamental aspect of our modern world view and, despite its lack of lived experiential evidence, holds on firmly in the process of unlearning.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate reality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream.
The Bhagavad Gita
<br>Suicide is the deliberate killing of oneself. Beware the silent solace and solitude of those seagrass meadows swaying like manes under the frosted surface of the rivers of death.<br>
You are but a droplet in a waterfall, don't rush the remerge, I'll meet you again somewhere, there is a house on an island, I think I saw laundry swaying too, in the wind, on a string tied between the porch and the oak, you know that oak, there was a cat warm purring slow tail, it surely lived, I smell coffee, meet me there, we can talk, or if nothing else, there is a patch under the oak, a patch of moss, it has your prints on it, don't go just yet.

 <br>Surveillance is the monitoring of activities and information for the purpose of influencing and managing. With the development of information technology and social media surveillance has become more sophisticated and, for most people, non-obvious. A security camera watching you has a clear purpose and is often visible to those being watched. An algorithm trying to predict behaviour from the movements of a mouse cursor is a very different story.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>All right, let's be absolutely ridiculously clear about this... Sustainable means, unsurprisingly, the ability of something to be sustained, to be held. Growth in this case refers to economic growth, meaning the value of goods and services produced by, let's say, all of human civilisation. For this growth to be based in reality its goods and services require resources, most likely finite, and most likely in an increasing amount despite technological improvements in efficiency. Sustaining growth based on any finite resource is not possible. Growing without the use of finite or, at the very least, slowly regenerating resources isn't either*. In short, sustainable growth is an oxymoron, it is fitting infinity in a finite space, it is not possible.<br>*Well, I guess anything's possible but it will not be possible in any world that resembles the one we live in.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>The Dark Triad of human psychology consists of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Briefly explained, narcissism is the focus on oneself, Machiavellianism is the ability to play others as pieces on a chess board, and psychopathy can mean impaired empathy and remorse, often combined with charm. Exhibit all traits of the dark triad and you'll most likely be well off in our modern civilisation. How many followers do you have on LinkedIn?<br>Outgoing connections:<br>
<br><a data-href="Animal views" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/animal-views.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Animal views</a> - If we retranslate the three traits of the dark triad we could say the exclusive focus on humans, playing/using animals as tools, slaves, pieces on a board, and...

Writing shit about new snow<br>
for the rich<br>
is not art.
Kobayashi Issa
<br>Corporations are sociopathic cybernetic entities that have the goal to grow by earning profits. Being employed by a corporation means that your purpose is to help the corporation create more profit than the worth of your salary. I'm afraid that's it. Creative work will then need to work similarly to a faucet or an industrial assembly process. The nature of most creative employment therefore erodes the source of true creativity and, if any creativity remains, that creativity will be used as profit-maximising fairy dust. So-called advertising. Due to the mechanistic and procedural process of modern creative work combined with the naturally intermittent bursts of human creativity, we see this field being one of the first fields to be replaced by artificial intelligence models.<br>
The craftsman who made the rose window at Chartres<br>
rose one morning in the dead of winter,<br>
shivered into what layers of wool he owned,<br>
and went to his bench to boil molten lead.<br>
This was not the day to cut the glass or dye it,<br>
lift it to the sun to see the colors dance<br>
along the walls, or catch one's breath<br>
at peacock shades of blue: only, today,<br>
to lay hot lead in careful lines, circles,<br>
wiping and trimming, making<br>
a perfect space for light.
When Wren designed St. Paul’s, he had to turn away<br>
each day from the vision in his mind's wide eye<br>
to scraps of paper where columns of figures measured<br>
tension and stress, heft and curve, angle and bearing point.<br>
Whole days he spent considering the density<br>
of granite, the weathering of hardwoods,<br>
the thickness of perfect mortar; all<br>
to the greater glory of God.
And Vermeer with his houseful of children<br>
didn't paint some days, didn't even mix<br>
powders or stretch canvasses, or clean palettes,<br>
but hauled in firewood, cleaned out<br>
a flue, repaired a broken cradle, remembering,<br>
as he bent to his task, how light shone gold<br>
on a woman’s flesh, and gathered<br>
in drops on her pearls.

Wendell Berry
<br>There is no place left on Earth that hasn't in some way been affected by modern civilisation. If we manage to thread the needle and enter a future of second chances we must initiate a resacration of the Earth.<br>The devastation that might follow from delving too deeply into the Earth or not paying ones respects to the spirits of the forests will open the gates to hell and, when opened, there are no sacred places left for the remaining spirits that have the power to overcome the demons spawned from our own depths.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.
James Carse, Finite &amp; Infinite Games
<br>One of the things that trap humans from doing what their families, local communities, society, and planet need is the obligation to, in order to earn a living, do what corporations and organisations need. Universal basic income could tackle this problem head-on by giving everybody a basic income with no strings attached. However, with the main incentive for nations being economic growth, UBI constantly gets blocked from becoming reality. UBI also requires governments and corporations to trust people to do the right thing, or anything, and since those who tend to rise to the top are ignorant of what the right thing, or anything, is there will always be colliding incentives here, with beliefs that anyone not forced to work will simply become a criminal or, god forbid, a lazy person.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
In the middle of the forest there’s an unexpected clearing that can only be found by those who have gotten lost.
The clearing is surrounded by a forest that is choking itself. Black trunks with the lichen’s bristly beard. The jammed trees are dead all the way to the top, there a few solitary green branches touch the light. Underneath:<br>
shadows sitting on the shadows, the marsh increasing.
But in the clearing the grass is curiously green and alive. Big stones lie around as if placed that way. They must have been foundation stones for a house, maybe I’m wrong. Who lived there? No one can help with that. The name sleeps somewhere in the archive no one opens (only archives remain young). The oral tradition is dead, and with it the memories. The gypsy tribe remembers, but those who can write forget. Write it down and forget it.
This little house hums with voices. It is the center of the world. But the people in it die or move away. The history ends. The place stands empty year after year. And the crofter’s house becomes a sphinx. At the end everything has gone away except the foundation stones.
I’ve been here before somehow, but it’s time to leave. I dive in among the briary underbrush. To get through it you have to take one step forward and two steps to the side, like a chess piece. Slowly it thins out and the light increases. My steps grow longer. A path wiggles its way toward me.&nbsp;I am back in the communications net.
On the humming high voltage pole a beetle sits in the sun. Under his gleaming shoulders his flight wings are lying, folded as ingeniously as a parachute packed by an expert.
Tomas Tranströmer
<br>The magic complexity of the wild does not compute, it does not produce, it does not follow our measures of success and progress. The wild can not be tamed, so we kill it, or we at least try to. In order for us to survive we must let the wild thrive, give it hooks to grab and crevices to grow through, vines and ivy, wisteria crowning the headstone of our buried civilisation as we tend to the eternal.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>
The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them. It is nothing other than the economy developing for itself. It is at once a faithful reflection of the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.
Guy Debord
<br>The spectacle is many things. We are all a part of it and its borders have become fuzzy, its extent far-stretching. In the words of Guy Debord, the more modern man "identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and his own desires. The spectacle’s estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by the fact that the individual’s gestures are no longer his own; they are the gestures of someone else who represents them to him" and, similarly to other predicaments of presencing versus representations, "in societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation".<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>Many complex systems have the characteristic that after a certain amount of gradual change a tipping point is reached where the entire system changes drastically or even completely collapses. The possibility of unknown tipping points makes any attempt at delaying the management of current predicaments potentially catastrophic. An important addition, however, is that tipping points can be both negative and positive, meaning that identifying and working towards positive tipping points should be of high priority. One example of such a tipping point might be that if a certain number of people begin changing how we do things it might create a discrete phase shift that rapidly includes everyone in the change process.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>With the restless expansion of the global market and its inclusion of everything we end up with a society lacking in one, public spaces that are free to spend time in and two, plots of land one is free to use for growing things. This presents us with the tragedy of the vanishing commons. Without free public spaces one gets increasingly cut off from one's social place in society and without a connection to the land one's natural place and belonging is lost. Why care about a society you have no part in and why care about a natural world you don't belong to?

 <br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/transportation.png"><br>The movement of people and their goods requires systems of transportation. Besides walking or running, modes of transportation include bikes, horses, animal-drawn carriages, boats, cars, motorcycles, planes, other air vehicles, railway vehicles, and more. These can further be divided into what power is driving them; air, electricity, fossil fuels, muscle, etc. Wheeled vehicles need roads and highways, boats need waterways and ports, airplanes need airports, trains and trams need railways, and people need safe places to walk. Horses just need peaceful retirement. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://devon.postach.io/post/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-asphalt" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://devon.postach.io/post/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-asphalt" target="_blank">The road to hell is paved with asphalt and the road to asphalt is paved with incentives</a> that, as with much else, ignore the long-term. Asphalt degrades fast, is expensive to change, absorbs heat, contributes to air pollution, and drains badly.

 <br>Travel is the movement of people across space between different geographical locations. It has never been as easy to travel as in modern times. It is so easy that travel is often seen as almost a right, a right to experience the world and go anywhere one wants. It is a difficult predicament. Travel might be the best way for humans to learn about the world and about other people. However, the more people can travel and the more globalised the world becomes one can go to the other side of the world and not really travel anywhere. How do we facilitate travel while keeping cultural and geographical diversity? How far does one have to go to travel?<br>
We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.

 <br>
Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present.
Albert Camus
<br>Several of our predicaments in the landscape come from an emphasis on the shortterm. Some initiatives counter this by emphasising the longterm, the far future. These also create predicaments. Cryogenics, geoengineering, interplanetary colonisation, mind-machine transfers, ending senescence, and other aims are commonly associated with longtermism. How much of a predicament this is can be discussed (as is the case with all predicaments) but there is something about longtermism that strikes me as highly artificial and untruthful. It badly hides the same hubristic desires that make up many of our other predicaments. Whatever infinity we want does not lie in duration but in the momentaneous, or so I think.<br>If we cannot balance the shortterm with the longterm we are fighting a losing battle against time and ourselves. Longtermism doesn't completely lack its valid points but, as with rationalism, it has become more and more a caricature of itself. And you can trust me on this, I'm a thought leader, transhumanist, futurist, and anthropreneur funded by YCombinator.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>There is much work that needs doing in the world, maybe now more than ever before, but this work does not fit neatly in the current job market. Most jobs are not work. Most employment is worthless. Even within the mainstream progress narrative the modern notion of jobs and employment is ridiculous. Since the industrial revolution the promise of technological development and increased efficiency has been the abolishment of labour, yet we seem to be moving further and further away from fulfilling that promise. The main reason for this is, unsurprisingly, the growth imperative. Unemployed people are not contributing to spinning the wheel of the machine so politicians want to report lowered unemployment as a sign of success. With very few exceptions, there is too much work to do to be employed. In response to people being unemployed I once heard an older man respond angrily that "someone has to steer the ship" and I'm still not sure who he was referring to.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>There have always been doomsday prophets on the streets. Why would our time be any different? Well, first of all, every civilisation that has existed has ceased to exist. Why should or civilisation be any different? Our civilisation is potentially different in that its collapse is running amok with a scorched earth tactic, taking many other beings with it. Several important trends have verticalised in the past decades, hinting at an exponentiality we have known about for a long time. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring warned of pesticide use in the 1960s, Limits to Growth modelled the outcomes of growth on a finite planet in the 1970s, adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere showed global warming as the result in calculations by Svante Arrhenius in the late 1800s, and other, less scientific warnings, have come from indigenous communities for centuries and even millennia. Nonetheless, something has changed since the industrial revolution and this change has become increasingly clear since about the middle of the 1900s. What is this change? An explosive increase in the extraction and use of energy, mostly fossil fuels. Pollution aside, adding this much energy to the atmosphere of our planet makes every other catastrophic factor more powerful and reactive. We have known about this for a long time but nothing has been done, quite the opposite, we have doubled down on a path framed in STOP-signs, corpses, and fire, seemingly unable to stop or change direction.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br>While Adam Smith, the "Father of Capitalism", wrote "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest" he lived with his mother who cared, cooked, and cleaned for him with, I wonder, only a regard to her own interest? Much important work goes unpaid and much unimportant work goes highly paid.

 <br>We keep studying human nature in systems that keep causing its corruption.<br>Most of the time that we blame human nature we should be blaming system dynamics which create conditions for human nature to adapt in a certain way.<br>Human nature can be many things. It can be unnecessarily violent and cruel and also peaceful and kind. Human nature is what we make it into.<br>

 <br>What is violence? What you think of is probably physical violence - causing bodily harm to someone. Violence is any path that uses undue force. Now, does any wise path actually require any force at all? There is violence in thought, words, and actions. To end violence, therefore, we must first find peace in our thoughts and perceptions.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>
<br><a data-href="Acceleration" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/acceleration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acceleration</a> - We humans often use violence to force ourselves forward, to accelerate along a path covered with obstacles.
<br><a data-href="Apathy" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/apathy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Apathy</a> - Violence requires and generates apathy towards the victim. Who is the victim?
<br><a data-href="Avoiding uncertainty" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/avoiding-uncertainty.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Avoiding uncertainty</a> - Certainty through violence. The slogan of modern man?

<br><a data-href="Cognitive dissonance" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/cognitive-dissonance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Cognitive dissonance</a> - Violence and cognitive dissonance have many connections. The two most clear ones are that cognitive dissonance often becomes a requirement for the wielder of violence when the victim's ability to fight back is low. The cognitive dissonance required to believe one to be a good person while throwing a baby out of a window and raping and killing the mother, as an example. The other is the cognitive dissonance required by both the perpetrator and the civilians on the perpetrator's side that justifies that violence. Just think for a moment... The other day I heard someone at my local gym scoff at the fact that there were protestors outside their university because a Swedish weapons manufacturer was there at a recruiting event. Now, this person is a fully reasonable person, relatively, and was fully entrenched in the opinion of the stupidity of these protestors. Meanwhile, clueless engineers mingle with students to find those most violently intelligent to work on efficient technology for killing humans. Apologies for this anecdote, maybe it sounds forced and far-fetched? I'm having difficulties with feelings of misanthropy at the moment. Every person who works with a certain weapon should have to live through its effects. You work designing missiles? Your family will have to sit inside a building while we practice firing at it. Fighter jets? We'll fly by your house shooting at it in the middle of the night. Ah, you work with surveillance? We'll track every step you and your children take and if a child speaks wrongly, we'll make them disappear. Don't worry, you'll get them back after the next sprint. It's on the kanban board.

Only thing is, he was wrong about civilisation somehow controlling the violence, instead it has only made it worse, subtler, more powerful, pervasive.

What is necessary for an act of violence to, for you, appear unjustifiable? What violent act requires no justification at all? What do you think when you drive past roadkill?

If certain crises end up snowballing into a world exclusively consisting of war and violence, what was the point of all this work anyway? What was the point of anything?

 <br>
It seems now that I was so near to that war.<br>
I was born eight years after it ended<br>
When the General Strike had been defeated.  
Yet I was born by Very Light and shrapnel<br>
On duck boards<br>
Among limbs without bodies.  
I was born of the look of the dead<br>
Swaddled in mustard gas<br>
And fed in a dugout.  
I was the groundless hope of survival<br>
With mud between finger and thumb<br>
Born near Abbeville.  
I lived the first year of my life<br>
Between the leaves of a pocket bible<br>
Stuffed in a khaki haversack.  
I lived the second year of my life<br>
With three photos of a woman<br>
Kept in a standard issue army paybook.  
In the third year of my life<br>
At 11am on November 11th 1918<br>
I became all that was conceivable.  
Before I could see<br>
Before I could cry out<br>
Before I could go hungry  
I was the world fit for heroes to live in.
Self-portrait 1914-18, John Berger
<br>A war is a violent conflict between two or more entities. Wars can have many purposes but the most common is for the victorious to become more powerful and the defeated to either become powerless or to be vanquished completely. Most modern warfare consists of proxy-wars between the most powerful on a global stage of assumed unimportant destruction, nowadays this lethal drama is set in the Middle East. However, as time goes on and the unfulfilled promises of modernity break the surface there will be increased tensions between all entities of power.<br>
War is the ultimate tool of politics.

<br><a data-href="Acceleration" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/predicaments/acceleration.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Acceleration</a> - War tends to accelerate several processes. There are perhaps two main reasons. One, close to entire populations and work forces suddenly focus on one thing only. The development and manufacturing of certain technologies benefit greatly from this monofocus. Many technological innovations have come from the need and desire to win wars. Secondly, war completely destroys any argument in favour of precautionary principles. Full steam ahead, you magnificent beast.

This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.
What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger.
The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us.
The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.
The danger is to the body, and it can kill.
The form of the danger is an emanation of energy.
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.

 <br>
The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter's view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the "saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment". But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.
Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism
<br>In simpler terms, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage" target="_blank">Weber's iron cage is the need for narrow specialisation of work and the focus of enterprises and organisations to maximise profits and increase efficiency</a> in present-day institutionalised capitalism. It is what traps us all in the requirement to keep the wheel spinning if we want to be a part of a civilisation whose partaking is no longer optional. We must work, we must profit, we must grow, we must accept bureaucracy and rationalisation as our inescapable fate.<br>
...specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilization never before achieved.
Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism

 <br>Wisdom is the embodied synthesis of understanding, the ability to contemplate and act out of knowledge, experience, intuition, insight and lived self-transcendence. Are we truly homo sapiens? Sapientia means wisdom and has its roots in the Latin verb sapere meaning "to discern, taste, or know". If we were once homo sapiens we are now morphing into its lesser ancestor, homo cogitans. The thinking man. Soon we might not even be that. Wisdom comes with the oughts that the knowing's is-es cannot arrive at.<br>People of our present and our past have planted trees of wisdom, trees which we must care for while we water our own saplings, envisioning a distant future of blooming bliss, children playing in the shade beneath their crowns, elders savouring the scent of their flowers, birds like gusts of wind over their tops, golden sunrise over woods of wisdom.<br>Outgoing connections:<br>

 <br><br>Work is progressing slowly. The illustrating of the Metacrisis of Evil has met some resistance but should be finished either at the end of the current month or at the start of the next. I've made it so the website (sort of) functions on mobile devices and I've also done a quick correction and styling check on half of the predicaments. More work to come, as always.<br>Other than that, we are now well and truly in autumn. The autumnal palette has swept across the landscape and most migratory birds have passed us by. It darkens early and the sun rises timidly most days. All seasons have their beauty but autumn displays its somber grace proudly. Some music that has accompanied this autumnal phase of predicament work:<br>

I must really remember to add silicone grease to the piston seal on the espresso machine soon... It's getting too creaky.<br>Surprisingly little has been added to the landscape as of late. The predicaments in the Metacrisis of Evil have had all of their links remade and motivated and I'll spend some time today correcting some errors there. Illustrations for the Metacrisis of Evil are almost finished, just need to digitise them and somehow add them to the main svg.

 <br><br>The work with this landscape is at a standstill. Certain conditions have lead to me having to focus on applying for jobs and this process seems to zap all energy from me. However, the work proceeds mentally and some aspects of this landscape are becoming clear.<br><br>The work that is most pressing is the outgoing links of the predicaments and their motivations. I believe these links are the key for a gestalt of our human predicament to start appearing. Nothing is ever a singular problem in isolation and no solution can be treated as a closed loop. As of writing this there are still 224 predicaments left that require re-linking as well as motivations written for those links. This can be facilitated by a continued work of...<br><br>Some predicaments fit neatly together like houses in a village, mountains on an island, or nations of a continent. There is an ongoing but non-published process of sorting and categorising predicaments. This serves two functions. Firstly, it's mentally much easier to work in chunks. Secondly, it is crucial for the map-making. See, the map-making, I have changed my approach...<br><br>There are two ideas currently floating around and I sense it might be necessary or at least valuable to pursue both. The first is to scrap the tiny part that has been mapped (with a bit too much detail) so far and instead simplify it to something whose landscape is clearly visible but where each predicament appears as a point of interest, similarly to something like this, drawn from the map for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/skyrim.png"><br>But there is, as mentioned, a second idea, an idea which includes the amount of links each predicament has. This idea is less clear in my mind but could it be reasonable to make a topographic map where every predicament category is a mountain range and each mountain a predicament? The height of the mountain could then be directly related to how many links the predicament has. Perhaps?<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/lib/media/topographic.png"><br>In summary, I will revise how the actual map is to be made and then most likely illustrate and then publish all of it at once instead of in tedious, badly hand-drawn chunks.<br>There is also a growing desire to turn away from the predicaments, the burning building of modernity, and turn towards life, towards what to do, what to envision. Currently, I just call this...<br><br>250 counter-elements to each predicament, hopefully with even more cosmic implications. I have started to write some of these already and will start publishing material soon. It is still mostly in research mode, where I collect resources, quotes, thoughts, ideas, and practices. The overlay excites me but it also scares me. Why? I'm not sure. There is, perhaps, a certain distance between one's self and one's complaints, as if expressing what one dislikes is just a stone cast into space. What one truly believes is good, beautiful, true, or right points straight to one's soul, it is a deeply personal exposure and each stone cast forms a structure reflecting one's deepest desires and dreams. It's easy to believe that everyone is too dumb for their own good. It's not that easy to wish that everyone could become wiser. Is it because it risks disappointment? Or it forces one to be clear about one's priorities? With luck and perseverance, some of these questions might approach answers as I dive into the work with the overlay.<br>What then? 250 predicaments and 250 overlaid possibilities. What has been achieved? I'm not sure.<br><br>The more I work with creating this landscape, the more aware I become of its purpose. You mustn't worry that I am somehow blissfully unaware of the fact that few, if any, will read all of it, or even any of it. The purpose of this landscape, at its core, is, I believe, a public research project that will lead to something else, something more accessible and, dare I say, straight-forward. The Predicament Landscape is a 5CD collection of free improvisation jam sessions that will, or might, be condensed into an album short enough to fit on an LP. If you know how Talk Talk recorded their last two albums you might have good idea of what I mean. If you don't, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Eden#Recording" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Eden#Recording" target="_blank">shame on you</a>. There is much uncertainty about how this will happen or what it will concretely be but since I am the way I am, I often prefer the improvisational jamming to the album. But that's me. I want to be of service to others and for all of this to have some sort of empowering effect on people, on you reading this.<br>
A writer is a person who cares what words mean, what they say, how they say it. Writers know words are their way towards truth and freedom, and so they use them with care, with thought, with fear, with delight. By using words well they strengthen their souls. Story-tellers and poets spend their lives learning that skill and art of using words well. And their words make the souls of their readers stronger, brighter, deeper.
Ursula K. Le Guin
<br>I don't see myself as a writer, in fact I don't see myself as anything, but I will continue to write and continue to do so with ferocity. Somehow, I will have to make it work while simultaneously prioritising providing for those I love. Challenging. But what is life if it lacks challenges?<br>---<br>If you want to have a chat about anything related to this, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:david@punk.ist" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/mailto:david@punk.ist" target="_blank">send me an email!</a><br>
Teach the children. We don't matter so much, but the children do. Show them daisies and the pale hepatica. Teach them the taste of sassafras and wintergreen. The lives of the blue sailors, mallow, sunbursts, the moccasin flowers. And the frisky ones – inkberry, lamb's-quarters, blueberries. And the aromatic ones – rosemary, oregano. Give them peppermint to put in their pockets as they go to school. Give them the fields and the woods and the possibility of the world salvaged from the lords of profit. Stand them in the stream, head them upstream, rejoice as they learn to love this space they live in, its sticks and leaves and then the silent, beautiful blossoms. Attention is the beginning of devotion.

 <br><br>I don't think you can see it yet. Maybe you can. Somewhere behind the blank dead stare of strangers and friends glad to be unhappy. They're breaking and so are you. Everything stapled onto dreamy castles of dust built on clouds of stale nitrogen nightmares will crack and fall and with so far to fall there's no wonder you see others breaking in the fall, violent explosions of feathers, black and white, splinters of bone. No bother. Everything will break. One day you will awake and all you know will be undone and when you look around you there will be nothing left except your two feet and the ground to stand on. Human. With luck you'll be there, I'll be there, and we can look up at the blank death of space, the living breathing pulsating milky way sweeping across a blackness filled with nothing but hairpin cracks of light. To my sister, father, mother, wife, Romeo, Hilma, and new life unborn, the only way to mend is for everything to break.]]></description><link>http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/updates/2025-01-19.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Updates/2025-01-19.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[punkist]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:56:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>
The landscape's purpose<br>
lies under its surface
To see both forest, trees,<br>
and mycelia beneath
<br>What is the point of this?<br>
All around, people are looking to act and do something. Often their eagerness to act, perhaps understandably so, outpaces their wisdom in choice of action. Don't get me wrong, we are in a hurry, in fact, we're too late, way too late. But one of the reasons for being late is that most attempted solutions have pushed us further down the same tracks we're eager to leave behind. The problem is that there isn't any singular problem. There are many, infinitely many, and we won't solve them. If we don't know where we are or where we are going it does not matter how fast we're moving. This landscape was mapped with a certain question in mind, namely, what is the problem? What are the problems of modernity? Are they even problems to begin with?<br>Predicaments<br>
Problems require solutions, predicaments require continuous management. Predicaments in the landscape are categories or formalisations of certain unfortunate or trying conditions. The landscape further hints at the main predicament of modernity, namely the complex and extensive network of connections between all predicaments. These connections are the reason why we seem unable to untangle ourselves from what appear to be solvable, if not already solved, problems. The network of tangled connections is the predicament of modernity. If we do not manage the predicaments of the landscape wisely we will lose everything. This is the challenge of our time and we must attempt to make sense of it to the best of our ability. By mapping the landscape and its features, describing what they are and how they're connected, my belief is that we might be able to go from an oversimplified narrative to a slightly more complex and interconnected understanding of our predicament. I am in no way the first to attempt this but I believe that each additional viewing angle can contribute in creating a parallax effect for the predicament of our time.<br>All of this is wrong<br>
The predicament landscape is affected by many of the predicaments it contains. It is therefore of importance to understand a few things before you dive in. These predicaments illustrate the difficulties of modernity in the same way an anatomical chart illustrates a human body. To understand the whole, we tend to need to break things down into categories, smaller parts that share certain characteristics. However, an anatomical chart gives no real understanding of life. Don't get caught up on any single predicament that happens to grab you. Rather, allow yourself to be swept away by what lies underneath all predicaments, the wholeness the landscape points towards. This is not an attempt to categorise the definitive predicaments, it is simply an illustration of one approach to making sense of our situation.<br>
The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.
Marcel Proust
<br>Ecology, Philosophy, and Poetry<br>
No single branch of science or the arts is enough to make sense of the complexity of our predicament. Instead, this project will move in-between and on the edges of whatever disciplines are necessary. There are however three that stick out, namely: ecology, philosophy, and poetry. Ecology is the study of our dwelling place. Philosophy is a love of wisdom as well as a comprehensive system of belief and principles. Poetry is... a difficult one to define. Which is its strength. Poetry is the process of emergence of something that did not previously exist. Poetry is making. Poetry tries to capture the unspeakable in words. Putting all of these together as ecophilosopoetic:<br>A philosophy for the making of our dwelling place<br>The future<br>
Discovering this landscape might lead to a sense of impending doom, hopelessness, and despair. Maybe rightly so. William Gibson said "the future has arrived, it's just not evenly distributed". There are ways of managing these predicaments and their connections and many are already being employed. The positive thing with complexity in this case is that just as we can't know what creates negative cascade effects we also can't be sure what creates positive ones. Complexity allows for emergence and unexpected behaviour. In other words, if there is room for complete despair there is also room for hope. My intention is two-fold. First, it is vital to recognise just how difficult of a situation we are in and, second, it is crucial to recognise that there are things we can and must do to manage the situation. What area of the landscape do you have an interest in? What predicament could you help manage? Which predicaments are related to what you're working to change? How might changing certain predicaments affect the management of the predicament you're focused on? Are there people prioritising predicaments you don't care about? Why do you think they prioritise in that way and what might be the reason for your indifference?<br>A problem well-stated is half-solved. This landscape does not give solutions or answers. My hope is that it leads those exploring it to find agency in discovering the right questions. I am tempted to say I want to provide a path through the landscape that leads to a better future but, for one, there isn't truly any real predicament landscape to walk through and, secondly, in the words of Krishnamurti, "truth is a pathless land".<br>A difficult realisation to come to terms with is this: If we make it, whatever we means and whatever making it means, we who are alive when this is being written will not live to see that different world because people very different from us will have to inhabit it. The change needed is on a timescale beyond a human life. What we will do however, what we must do, is find the flower-filled cracks of modern life and find our strength there, make our dwelling there and do the work needed by us to spread outward. There lies life. In that way, maybe, the king could again have a crown.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/img/kingcrown.png">  <br>How to read this<br>
Reading this may require certain skills and abilities we've largely let atrophy. If I was to pick one thing needed to read this properly it would be acceptance of confusion. Let yourself be confused for longer than you're inclined to. Let me illustrate what I mean with a quick example. If you're reading a book where words unknown to you keep popping up you might stop at each word, look it up in a dictionary, and continue reading. That approach will not work particularly well in this case. The alternative is to simply keep reading and instead of letting the text linearly create a path you must allow the drawing out of a patchy line and trust that the process will eventually lead to the line being filled out. Float through sections you don't understand, trudge through sections that confuse you, push through or temporarily skip sections that generate resistance and frustration. If you've ever thought that koans are bullshit I implore you to explore it further and reconsider. If and when this writing creates confusion, contradiction, or incites strong emotion, I believe that is when things get interesting and fertile for change.<br>Links - Outgoing &amp; Incoming<br>
Do not confuse the direction of links between predicaments for causality or anything resembling direct linear effects. Outgoing links are what a predicament might flow towards, drive, feed into, lead to, or create. If a predicament is a body of water, the outgoing links are rivers, creeks, and rapids flowing away from that body of water. Incoming links are the inflows to that body of water. Incoming links might drive the selected predicament, outgoing links might be driven by the selected predicament. Sort of. Maybe.<br>The Predicaments<br>

<br>Note: In progress<br>
As you can probably see, much of the landscape is unfinished. I have chosen to work publicly on this project and there is much left to do. Some of the future plans:<br>
<br>Go through all connections and add more
<br>Motivate each connection/link between predicaments
<br>Illustrate each predicament
<br>Illustrate the landscape/map
<br>Add sources and fix a footnote system
<br>Add links, further reading, emphases, and more
<br>Start writing part II, the overlay of existing and future methods of managing the predicaments - <a data-href="The Overlay" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/the-overlay.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Overlay</a>. If you have suggestions for this, please get in touch!
<br>Note: Poetry and pretentiousness<br>
It is absolutely okay to not understand what the fuck I'm talking about in some of the predicaments. It is also fine if you roll your eyes at the postmodernistic pseudopoetic pretentious mess that I sometimes dive into. Try reading it backwards or upside down and it might make more sense. Maybe put on some <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOFBkc2pWWQ" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOFBkc2pWWQ" target="_blank">calming jazz</a> and read it out loud. Or maybe just brew yourself a cup of single origin anaerobic Ethiopian heirloom variety espresso on your 1981 La Pavoni Europiccola while contemplating how much Proust loves hawthorn bushes. Beats me. I love you.<br>Note: Disagreement<br>
Do you disagree with something? Do you think something is blatantly wrong or deluded? Do you think something here might create more problems? Do you have something you think should be added? Do you think I'm an idiot? Do you disagree so vehemently that you feel a wrath that could split the Earth? Cool. Don't hesitate to write me an email. I'm grateful for any feedback or input that you might have. I'm not an expert, I'm just an innocent explorer trying to slowly wander upon truths. In this exploration I will, as you will, be both lead and corrupted by my conditioning, personality, opinions, and excentricities. Maybe we can help each other see the in-between?<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:david@punk.ist" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/mailto:david@punk.ist" target="_blank">david@punk.ist</a><br>Note: Who am I to believe I have something to say?<br>
I am no one and, in John Cage's words, I have nothing to say and I am saying it and that is poetry as I need it. I'm just trying to channel and synthesise what others are saying and maybe spice it up a bit. Don't worry about who I am, it matters not. But again, it also does. I'm just a normal guy. Read into that what you must.<br>Note: Opinions<br>
Maybe everything I've ever written is just a hyperrationalisation of why I like what I like. Yeah, I really love riding bikes, I always have. I like old buildings and jazz more than new buildings and pop. I happen to really fucking loathe the workings of modernity and the bullshit-spewing morons it makes of us. Just my opinions though. I guess I'm just lucky in that all my opinions happen to also be correct. Strange how that happens.<br>Note: Missing Predicaments<br>
These predicaments are arbitrary points in a continuous landscape of predicaments. In other words, I could've picked 250 completely different predicaments. However, I believe this isn't that important.<br>Let's take, as an example, some predicaments I haven't included. Gut bacteria and Screen time for children. There is a case to be made, quite a convincing one, that almost everything about modernity could stem from a reduced diversity of gut microbiota in the global population. It might almost sound ridiculous but research keeps heightening the seeming importance of the gut microbiota in everything from mental health issues to overall mood and thinking. When I claim that most issues of modernity start as thoughts and these thoughts are influenced by our gut microbiota then shouldn't that be a central predicament? Well, perhaps. Instead of focusing on every single predicament we should envision the gestalt they're a part of. Some predicaments that could be related to gut microbiota are Access to food, Complexity mismatch, Malnutrition, Monocultures (Agriculture), and Pandemics. What food do we have access to? Is our microbiota as complex as it used to be or needs to be? Have we reduced the diversity of the microbiota through malnutrition and agricultural practices? Has our war on bacteria related to the fear of pandemics played a part in this? All of these connections between the included predicaments circle an area of the landscape that could contain several other predicaments. Find those connections yourself, grasp the entire landscape's gestalt, and you're getting it. The same goes with the example of screen time for children. Put an iPad in front of a three year old and I wouldn't be surprised if you irreversibly screw them up. What might that be connected to in the landscape?<br>Note: For Hilma<br>
If you have found value in this project and you have a steady income I would be grateful for any donations you could give. If you need further incentive most of the donations will go to feeding my dog Hilma. As you can see, she is very skinny and needs all the food she can get.<br><img src="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/img/hilma.png"><br>
<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ko-fi.com/punkistpoet" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://ko-fi.com/punkistpoet" target="_blank">Buy Hilma some food</a><br>Note: Why 250?<br>
Why 250 predicaments? Why not one single predicament which, if we manage it, makes everything right? Why not 10 or 100 or 1000? Mostly, it's arbitrary. But not entirely. Every system can be divided into an infinite amount of subsystems, complexity arises on all scales and will always have to be abstracted in order to make sense of anything. One must choose where to draw boundaries. The main inspiration for the structure of this work is the architectural tome A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander et al. Their book is divided into 253 different architectural patterns on different scales and these patterns are, like the predicaments, connected in different ways. A Pattern Language includes this in its introduction: "At the core is the idea people should design their homes, streets, and communities. This idea comes from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects, but by the people". Most of the wonderful care for the world comes not from politicians, economists, investors, technologists, or rulers, but by the people. That source of inspiration is one reason for the 250 predicament boundary.<br>The other reason is that I've found 250 to be a good number for me to understand the whole of something without getting lost in the parts, still seeing the forest while french-kissing a single beech leaf. I have also found it to be a number of predicaments large enough to feel challenging but low enough to feel possible. But, in short, the boundary is mostly arbitrary.<br>Note: Structure<br>
Every predicament in the landscape contains three parts. The first part acts as a summary, definition, or similar of the predicament in question. The second part details the predicament's connection to other predicaments in the landscape and how these connections might behave. The third part attempts to find some way of management, be that through identifying leverage points, cascade effects, existing solutions, or progressive initiatives. This third part will most likely be an overlay on the landscape that sees the possibilities of a better future through existing or future initiatives.<br>Note: What about the solutions?<br>
Well, first of all, there are none. There are potential management methods, initiatives, changes, directions, all of which will affect the landscape. Currently, this landscape focuses on the question that triggered its creation, namely "what's the problem?", but there is an ongoing thought process in the back of my head collecting what I think the landscape needs of us. My first project <a class="internal-link" data-href="www.punk.ist" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/www.punk.ist" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">punk.ist</a> was, in hindsight, an attempt to find pockets of sane actions in the insanity of the world. Presently, there is simply a list of ideas I call the <a data-href="The Overlay" href="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/the-overlay.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Overlay</a>.<br>Note: Before you dive in...<br>
Quick therapy session. Lay back, chill out, breathe. To truly internalise the complexity of the mess we're in you might go through some difficult emotions. In fact, there is something missing if you don't. Before you dive in it is useful if you have a place of support and comfort to return to. This could be mindfulness of breathing, music, taking a walk, being with a loved one, or similar. Just make sure you don't push yourself into too much suffering in order to "understand" or "get" the gist of the landscape. Surf smoothly, don't crash and splash. Good luck. Oh, and if you lack support you can simply send me an email and we'll see what we can do.<br>Note: Footbinding<br>
Are your feet bound? There is an old Chinese tradition known as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding" target="_blank">foot binding</a>, the aim of which is for women to have so called lotus feet, a status symbol and mark of beauty. Can you remember when your feet were bound? There was a time during my childhood where a tear developed in the binding. The years passed but the fabric continued to tear, slowly, despite my efforts to patch it up. A new tear appeared during my university studies, the flesh of my foot nearly bulged out of it, the fresh air burning its skin. Years later, the binding broke. None of my shoes would fit my wide and ugly feet. I started regaining muscle and control of my toes. I could walk, I could run, though it appeared strange to others. They're now calloused and strong, they keep me grounded and stable on the ground. There's just one issue. For certain parts of my existence and the wellbeing of those I am responsible for I have to wear modernity's shoes, yet none fit, they're cramped and angled, people I talk to might humour me but they know I'll always be barefoot. Take off your shoes and join me? It will be too difficult to find your way in the landscape with feet bound. In the words of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiu_JinQiu" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiu_JinQiu" target="_blank">Qiu Jin</a>, unbinding my feet I clean out a thousand years of poison.<br>Note: Doubts about darkness<br>
Should I avoid writing from sources that contain lifetimes of darkness, anger, hatred, and despair? There is a vital point in honesty and multifaceted emotions... But can the words be charged with the same hatred they're aiming to extinguish without spreading more hatred instead?<br>Note: I am not wise<br>
You might be wondering what right I have to write all of this. Do I really know enough? Am I clever? Am I wise? We all have varying degrees of wisdom and I often find that there are several voices within that come out in the writing of this work, some less wise than others. Others slightly more wise. I believe there is value in this simply because this type of thinking is so unexplored today that whatever tiny bit of wisdom and intellect one can pour into it, it will change it. I am young. I've always been slow to learn, slow to understand, bad at most things. I am not wise, at least not yet. I've had a privileged upbringing, but still, I have missed many, maybe even most, of my past years in mists of depression. I often speak more than I listen, act less than I think, and feel less than I think. There are conditioned beliefs that are near impossible to discern from truth, there is anger, aggression, hatred, crashing waves in places of required stillness, dried up rivers that should smooth out the crust of the Earth. Do not get hung up on who has written all of this, just try to find what resonates or changes you. Wisdom is not a state of being, it is a flow of becoming. It also matters little whether or not I am wise or you are wise. What matters is the collective wisdom.<br>Note: Doubts about explicitness]]></description><link>http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/the-predicament-landscape.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Predicament Landscape.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[punkist]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:26:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/img/kingcrown.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.predicamentlandscape.com/img/kingcrown.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
