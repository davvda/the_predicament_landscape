# Promise of snow
There is talk of snow. It's still a bit too warm for any snow to build up but I wholeheartedly welcome the falling flakes supposed to arrive later today. Meanwhile, Hilma sleeps under the blanket on the couch and I'm burning some incense on our balcony. The espresso I just brewed up turned out surprisingly well. I must really remember to add silicone grease to the piston seal on the espresso machine soon... It's getting too creaky.

Surprisingly little has been added to the landscape as of late. The predicaments in the Metacrisis of Evil have had all of their links remade and motivated and I'll spend some time today correcting some errors there. Illustrations for the Metacrisis of Evil are almost finished, just need to digitise them and somehow add them to the main svg. Not quite sure how to make sure it all displays properly but I'm sure I'll figure it out.
