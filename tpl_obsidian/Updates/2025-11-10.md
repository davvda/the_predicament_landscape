# Different Times
Having become a father of a four month old little wonder **this project has been put in the backseat for a while**. However, it's still along for the ride and on some early mornings when everyone's asleep I chip away at the links and link motivations. More then halfway now. Just as expected it's taking longer than I expected. I'm eager to start properly writing the Overlay, but the predicaments must be dealt with first. 

I sense that I'm part of some larger underlying movement in the world, turning away from the problematic, almost giving up in a positive way, turning towards whatever one wishes to see and create. Perhaps the realisation that whatever one wants to see in the world has no chance of arising in the conventional systems and thought patterns that keep leading us towards already broken promises? I'm not totally sure but I find great optimisim in finally giving up. Instead of staring into the flames, despair burning in my lungs, desperately trying to save it all, constantly trying to draw people's attention to just how fucked everything is, how screwed *we* are, wanting others to see deeply what I see, suffer along with me, no, instead of all that, turning away from the flames, **towards something that isn't exclusively defined by what it is not**. 

My gaze has been turned but I still need a bit more time to connect and describe what's been seen in the flames. It's the right thing to do.

Now, writing directly to **the state of this project**. If you're reading this you're seeing an updated version of The Predicament Landscape which includes what I've managed to produce so far. 250 predicaments, half of which have connections and motivations, approximately 250 overlay points not yet written, with varying degrees of content, mostly for my own remembering, research them yourself if you feel inclined. Much remains but much is also in place. However, I do believe the finished landscape will provide material for a more holistic perspective from which further insights can be revealed.

While you're here, check out some of the Overlay points that have some content added, such as [[Attention]], [[Acceptance]], [[New life]], [[Quit your job]], [[The sublime]], [[Wholeness]], [[Zen]]. Slightly more inspiring and hopeful than the predicaments, don't you think? But then again, the light will appear brighter if you've looked deeply into the darkness. Keep working.
