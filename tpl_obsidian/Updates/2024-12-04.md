# Alive again
December. After switching to a different antibiotic I am now finally getting better from the pneumonia that's been most of my existence for the past three weeks. It has resulted in me missing quite a lot. That's life. It has also made me rethink how to progress with the landscape but more on that soon... First, I need to keep resting and return to normal health.

* Turns out all it took for me to start loving pickles was severe dehydration
* Discovered Schmachtenberger's list of [Dharma Inquiries](https://civilizationemerging.com/dharma-inquiry-2/) which provide excellent material for reflection, especially now that the year is coming to a close
*   Plenty of music has been listened to:
	* Kayo Dot - Choirs of the Eye
	* Bluetile Lounge - Lowercase
	* Bluetile Lounge - Half Cut
	* Oceansize - Music for Nurses
	* Steve Hiett - Down On The Road By The Beach
	* The Taj-Mahal Travellers - August, 1974
	* Mal Waldron & Terumasa Hino - Reminicent Suite
	* This Heat - This Heat
	* Stars of the Lid - The Ballasted Orchestra

Hoping you're all well. Expect more to come here before the year's over.
