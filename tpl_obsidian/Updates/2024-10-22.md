# Drizzle and treetops like flames
Work is progressing slowly. The illustrating of the Metacrisis of Evil has met some resistance but should be finished either at the end of the current month or at the start of the next. I've made it so the website (sort of) functions on mobile devices and I've also done a quick correction and styling check on half of the predicaments. More work to come, as always.

Other than that, we are now well and truly in autumn. The autumnal palette has swept across the landscape and most migratory birds have passed us by. It darkens early and the sun rises timidly most days. All seasons have their beauty but autumn displays its somber grace proudly. Some music that has accompanied this autumnal phase of predicament work:
