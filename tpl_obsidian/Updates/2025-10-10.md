# Insights from the Landscape
Continuous and arbitrary. But not quite, not completely, not all the way through. It has now been a while since I started mapping this landscape. What is this landscape? What does it have to say? Isn't it simply a long list of problems? I have no clear conclusion but I have arrived at the borders of certain vague and diffuse insights, some of which I will attempt to explain here, mostly for the purpose of making the thoughts more explicit and communicable. 
### Continuous and almost arbitrary
My wife once said that nothing turns me on more than recursion. Almost a year ago now, I was walking to the gym when a thought, most likely obvious to any researcher of complex systems, struck me as profoundly true. I had just read about the concept of universality classes, categorisations of complex systems that allow them to be mathematically modelled in a simpler way than their complexity on other scales might suggest. To be fully transparent, my intellect is not structured in a way that allows me to understand much of what I've read about universality classes or complex systems theory. However, the thought that struck me was that flowing up and down in scale, zooming in and out, every possible universality class would pop up and, most importantly, even when zooming in or out **infinitely**, the behaviour of systems and subsystems at particular scales will fall within a **finite** amount of universality classes. Let me give an example that might illuminate. Some systems flow like spirals. Galaxies, whirlpools, subatomic particles. Same universality class, very different in scale. Zoom into parts of galaxies and you might find clusters or repeating patterns that are then found again at smaller or larger scales, perhaps not just in space but also in the scale of time, I don't know. So, okay, flowing continuously through scales there are to be found certain specific behaviours and process patterns whose amount is finite. Cool. How is this relevant? Well, take that piece of the puzzle, feel its weight and we'll soon return to it.
### Christopher Alexander's Centers
The main source of inspiration for the structure of the predicament landscape is Christopher Alexander et al's A Pattern Language, a book consisting of 250-ish architectural patterns. Alexander's The Nature of Order tried to further generalise the philosophy behind the patterns through a concept he calls centers.

Christopher Alexander fucking *loves* rugs.

A center is “an organized zone of space … which, because of its internal coherence, and because of its relation to context … forms a local zone of relative centeredness with respect to the other parts of space". In the example of an A4 paper with a dot drawn on it there are many centers. The horizontal segments bounded by the dot, the vertical segments bounded by the dot, the four quadrants created by the dot, the entire paper, the dot itself, a certain area around the dot itself, and the list could go on. Alexander believes that a deep understanding of centers is crucial for architects to create places that sustain thiving human life. Taking this even further, I believe centers touch on something that is crucial for anyone to understand in order to create anything that sustains thriving human life, or perhaps even creates it from the very start. **A wholeness consisting of centers which positively intesify each other creates coherence and profound beauty**. In the first book of The Nature of Order Alexander lays out fifteen fundamental properties of how centers intensify each other:

1. Levels of scale
2. Strong centers
3. Boundaries
4. Alternating repetition
5. Positive space
6. Good shape
7. Local symmetries
8. Deep interlock and ambiguity
9. Contrast
10. Gradients
11. Roughness
12. Echoes
13. The void
14. Simplicity and inner calm
15. Not-separateness

If you, like me, first respond with a feeling of discomfort at how "subjective" much of this is, I urge you to, like I ended up doing, look more into phenomenology as a philosophical field to get a better understanding of why expressions like "*good* shape" aren't as subjective as they first appear. Perhaps check out Husserl or Merleau-Ponty. Fuck, where's my Galois and overly frothy cortado? I could go into each of the fifteen properties and explain their relevance but, for now, listing them will suffice. Onward to the next puzzle piece.
### Wendell Berry's Solving for Pattern
I've hopefully made it clear that I have a problem with the notion of problems, bullet points on a list that require solving until we one day reach the end of the list and arrive at blissful utopia. However, solving or resolving predicaments (or problems if you insist on the word) can be achieved in different ways. Wendell Berry, everybody's favourite farmer grandpa, has some ideas here. There are three types of solutions, "first, the solution that causes a ramifying series of new problems, the only limiting criterion being, apparently, that the new problems should arise beyond the purview of the expertise that produced the solution". **Ignored externalities**, illusion of competence, naive progress narrative, biased evidence selection, failure to take responsibility, ignoring complexity, ignoring diversity, lack of systems thinking, etc, etc. "The second kind of solution", he continues, "is that which immediately worsens the problem it is intended to solve, causing a hellish symbiosis in which problem and solution reciprocally enlarge one another in a sequence that, so far as its own logic is concerned, is limitless". Energy, over-reliance on technology, **growth**, surveillance, monocultures (agriculture), violence, and war. Finally, the third kind of solution is what relates to the predicament landscape and how its pseudospatial aspect becomes interesting in relation to centers and system flow patterns. Commenting on the two kinds of solutions above, Berry writes that "such solutions always involve a definition of the problem that is either false or so narrow as to be virtually false. To define an agricultural problem as if it were solely a problem of agriculture – or solely a problem of production or technology or economics – is simply to misunderstand the problem, either inadvertently or deliberately, either for profit or because of a prevalent fashion of thought. The whole problem must be solved, not just some handily identifiable and simplifiable aspect of it." How, then, does one solve *the whole problem*? How can one untangle the predicament? The third kind of solution causes "a ramifying series of solutions ... The farmer has put plants and animals into a relationship of mutual dependence, and must perforce be concerned for balance or symmetry, a reciprocating connection in the pattern of the farm that is biological, not industrial, and that involves solutions to problems of fertility, soil husbandry, economics, sanitation - the whole complex of problems whose proper solutions add up to health: the health of the soil, of plants and animals, of farm and farmer, of farm family and farm community, all involved in the same internested, interlocking pattern – or pattern of patterns". Excuse all the quotes but it's all so important. To summarise, Berry writes that "a bad solution is bad, then, because it acts destructively upon the larger patterns in which it is contained" and "a good solution is good because it is in harmony with those larger patterns". 
### Solving for Wholeness
Let us try to summarise even further and also relate it to the predicament landscape. Everything in the universe flows in complex patterns that can be discerned as system models at different scales. These patterns can act as centers that vitally(?) and consciously(?) strengthen, weaken, create, or destroy the surrounding patterns of flow, and every flow pattern's effect (which can be adequately modelled as finite) at every scale further influences the whole (which should always be understood as infinite). Having chosen the scale where around 250 predicaments are discernible, the core question then appears: **which actions within each predicament positively affect the surrounding predicaments in ways that harmonise with our intentions and aspirations? Which landscape overlay can most wisely alter the flow of the predicament landscape in a way that creates a more harmonious wholeness by considering levels of scale, deep interlock and ambiguity, echoes, the void, simplicity and inner calm, and not-separateness?**
### Less vague
If I have to be less vague... The predicament landscape contains a bunch of predicaments, issues, problems, crises, all of which somehow relate to each other. Their interrelated nature is what creates the immense difficulty of avoiding collapse or, more truthfully, to make it through and past ongoing collapse. We need to figure out how to create positive feedback loops that spread through the landscape instead of the constantly compounding negative ones we see currently. This is where the Overlay comes in. The purpose of the overlay is to find positive feedback and compounding effects that can radiate out from each action across the landscape and alter it slightly in a beneficial and hopefully more wise direction. Both the predicaments and the overlays are just guesses taken on hunches and intuition about what is clearly bad or hopefully good, either to directly act on or at least consider. We will always have a predicament landscape but we must work to counter the devastating effects of the current one on our actual landscape and reality. These are just models intended to be helpful in thinking about what to do with your life in this time and place. I believe they've already been useful to me so, with luck, they can be for you as well.
### More vague, more true
Still, all of the above is still too... intellectual? Analytical? Too much talk about systems, control, solving, fixing. Not enough life. Should I just pick up my Telecaster for a while? We might've moved beyond the point of explanation. **"Cease to do evil, learn to do good. Purify your own mind: that is the teaching of all Buddhas".** Get to it.
