**Suicide is the deliberate killing of oneself**. Beware the silent solace and solitude of those seagrass meadows swaying like manes under the frosted surface of the rivers of death.

> You are but a droplet in a waterfall, don't rush the remerge, I'll meet you again somewhere, there is a house on an island, I think I saw laundry swaying too, in the wind, on a string tied between the porch and the oak, you know that oak, there was a cat warm purring slow tail, it surely lived, I smell coffee, meet me there, we can talk, or if nothing else, there is a patch under the oak, a patch of moss, it has your prints on it, don't go just yet.
