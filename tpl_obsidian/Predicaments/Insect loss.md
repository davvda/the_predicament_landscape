Insects make up 90% of all animal species on Earth and are crucial parts of all ecosystems with pollinators being particularly important for the food supply for other animals and humans. Insect decline is a complex area to study and estimates on the rate of decline vary in different localities. A 2020 meta-analysis estimated a decline rate of 9% per decade for terrestrial insects but, notably, an increase in freshwater insects of 11% per decade. Most research, however, show declines in insects globally.

> A March 2019 statement by the [Entomological Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America "Entomological Society of America") said _there was not yet sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects_ and that some of the extrapolated predictions might "have been extended well past the limits of the data or have been otherwise over-hyped"

I wonder what to make of the quote above. Data can always be misleading but if we are actually **risking a mass extinction of insects** I don't see how taking that seriously is over-hyping. If what we need before we decide to change current trends is "sufficient data" to be collected then we really are fucked.

> We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Acceleration]]** - Things might happen quite quickly if the droning hum of spring flowers is no longer accompanied by buzzing of bees.
*   **[[Access to food]]** - No pollination, no food. Mostly.
*   **[[Biased evidence selection]]** - Well, actually, where I live there seem to be a lot of mosquitoes nowadays. What do you say to that, huh?
*   **[[Biodiversity loss]]** - Insects make up an enormous part of the species of the planet and support most other species.
*   **[[Catastrophic risks]]** - It might sound like an exaggeration but if we suddenly lack the necessary amount of pollinators to keep our food production up we are well and truly fucked.
*   **[[Complexity mismatch]]** - With a reduction of insects we have a heavily reduced natural complexity.
*   **[[Delusional domination of nature]]** - Well, I mean... To be fair, we appear to be quite good at developing working insecticides. Go humans.
*   **[[Ecological crisis]]** - Insect loss is a massive part of the global ecological crisis.
*   **[[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]]** - Even if we halted insect loss today there would most likely need to be active initiatives to restabilise and reintroduce insect populations.
*   **[[Ignoring diversity]]** - Those who claim we aren't actually reducing the total amount of insects seem to be in a rut of quantification where a million honey bees are equal to a million different bee species. Diversity matters. More honey bees are not the solution.
*   **[[Naive techno-optimism]]** - Maybe we can just replace insects with tiny drones or something? Oh, [great...](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/robobees-autonomous-flying-microrobots/) I swear, we'll invent mosquitobots to make it feel like we're really in nature before we do anything about insect loss.
*   **[[Over-reliance on technology]]** - The more we lose of the natural systems aiding in activities like food production, the more reliant we become on high-tech solutions to "save" us, or at least kick the bucket further down the road.
*   **[[The minimisation of all things wild]]** - Most wild places are filled with crawling, buzzing, and flying.
*   **[[Tipping points]]** - How long until insect populations collapse completely? And what follows from such a collapse?
