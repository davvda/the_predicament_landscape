**Individualism emphasises the intrinsic worth of the individual**, the singular person. Individualism has become a predicament more because of the things it doesn't do rather than the things it does. Its focus on individual goal-achieving, self-reliance, and independence only become an issue when taken to extremes in opposition to collective welfare, community, interdependence, and broader awareness of one's belonging and contributions. What is freedom?

- [[Ignorance of the mystical]] - Does your lived experience support your thesis of who you are, truly?
- [[Ignoring complexity]] - Even when excluding any mystical aspects, the model of the individual doesn't stand up to much scrutiny. Embedded in a social context with its culture, history, place, language, the current state of an ever-going process of genetic permutations with ever-combining ancestral branches, roots, shoots spreading out both backwards and forwards in time, the way the nightsky looks particularly far away in the fall, who, really, who the fuck are you?
