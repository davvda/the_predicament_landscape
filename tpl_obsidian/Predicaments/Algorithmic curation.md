**Algorithmic curation is the organising and presentation of online media using algorithms designed to personalise the content shown**. Its purpose is mainly to increase the platform's revenue by keeping the user coming back and staying for longer. It takes the power of choice and agency from the user and instead puts it in the platform's hands, portraying this switch as something beneficial for the user. Algorithmic curation can be used for good but will mainly follow the incentives and top priorities of the owners of the platforms, these priorities are seldom the well-being of its users.

Algorithmic curation, in its present form and with its current surroundings, leaves us scrolling, paying, unhappy, horny, angry, and unknowingly obedient. Eat the rich.

Settle down, Mark, you're moving fast enough.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]] - Algorithmic curation accelerates many processes. One example is how efficiently it accelerates people's political views towards radical extremes.
- [[Addiction]] - A highly successful algorithmic curation makes addicts of the service's users.
- [[Advertising]] - Most efforts to curate media and information algorithmically are done for the sake of more effective advertising.
- [[Artificial intelligence]] - Algorithmic curation is and has been a major driver in popularising the use of artificial intelligence.
- [[Attention hijacking]] - Algorithmic curation has as its purpose to shape your attention.
- [[Blaming the people]] - If you have an issue with algorithmic curation, that's on you. We simply serve you what you truly want to see.
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - Algorithmic curation pigeon holes people into echo chambers that form their view of reality, a reality wholly different than the ones presented in other pigeon holes.
- [[Constant connectivity]] - Algorithmically curated feeds are designed to keep you scrolling.
- [[Democracy failing]] - Algorithmic curation is a key player in the failing of democracy.
- [[Disinformation]] - Disinformation is often highly engaging and therefore spread by the algorithms.
- [[Educational crisis]] - I believe they call it brainrot?
- [[Ego]] - Whatever the algorithms may be optimising for it is rarely our noble higher nature.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - How would social media companies even begin to take responsibility for how they've changed the world?
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - Imagine algorithmically curated media optimising for the well-being of its users. In the great chain of optimisations the shit trickles down from the top.
- [[Fear]] - Strong emotions like fear keep people engaged with whatever content gets served.
- [[Hyperstimuli]] - The more extreme content often wins the algorithmic battle.
- [[Identity]] - What identity hole have you been squeezed into by the feeds you regularly roll through?
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - You might be thinking that the services you use that have algorithmic curation are simply useful. Maybe you're recommended music that you like or the commercials you see feel more relevant to your life. Can you truly claim to understand what is going on long-term, the incentives of the services, the potential sculpting of your tastes, preferences, identity, attention, and thoughts? I'm not writing this from a place of superiority where I claim to understand it. I don't understand what this constant nudging could do to me so I try my best to avoid it because I am at least convinced that the incentives of most companies presenting algorithmically curated feeds are opposite to my own. My advice to you is that service that has clear utility while having questionable incentives should be avoided. Don't trust your lower self to be deaf to their whispers.
- [[Information isn't knowledge]] - How many people do you speak to on a regular basis who only seem to retell whatever information they've been fed recently? 
- [[Mental health]] - Doomscrolling has fucked an entire generation.
- [[Misinformation]] - It doesn't have to be true to be engaging. In fact, truth is rarely that engaging.
- [[Naive techno-optimism]] - Your entire life could be managed by minds more intelligent than yours!
- [[Naive techno-pessimism]] - Once again, the technologies behind algorithmic curation *can* be used for good. They most likely won't be for most people. But they can. As with many other predicaments we have a dissonance between intentions and incentives. 
- [[News]] - Many people are served news, they rarely actively seek it out.
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - Maybe the clearest example of such a tyranny.
- [[Predicaments/Parenting]] - Between the crying baby in the pram and the attentive loving eyes of a mother lies a shard that establishes connectivity by breaking all connections. The chasm between them might as well be infinite.
- [[Polarisation]] - Algorithmic curation can and often does lead to polarisation when applied to news feeds or anything relating to politics.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - The world's most successful tech companies have the power to control what their users know, think, and feel.
- [[Sameness]] - Strangely, with our highly personalised diverse media feeds we all end up more or less the same. 
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]] - Stay put, keep scrolling. In all seriouesness though, if you're reading this right now, which you are, I urge you to close the book or turn off the computer and go outside. Nothing would make me happier than the rest of my work remaining unread because you decided to go outside.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - When information is served to you according to other actor's obscure incentives nothing will make any sense, however, they will appear to.
- [[Sex and sexuality]] - All social media rivers lead to the great ocean of OnlyFans. 
- [[Social erosion]] - Algorithmic curation and its radicalising capabilities rapidly erodes any form of social cohesian we've previously had or might've wished for.
- [[Social media]] - Few modern social media lack algorithmic curation.
- [[The spectacle]] - All just controlling and tweaking the spectacle.
- [[Yuppie dystopia]] - You know that new Roomba I bought? Yeah, I found it through an Instagram ad. No, yeah, it mops too!
