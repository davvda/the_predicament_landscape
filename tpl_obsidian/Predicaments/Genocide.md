**Genocide is the intentional destruction of a people**. People, cultures, and traditions whose voices must be silenced for the greater good of modernity have two options. Assimilate and forget or be annihilated. There are very few peoples left to annihilate but many, perhaps most, contemporary military conflicts have genocidal traits.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Avoiding uncertainty]]** - Deciding that the best solution is to exterminate your problem is mostly a decision of avoiding uncertainty.
*   **[[Blaming the people]]** - They were a threat, y'see? They couldn't behave 'emselves, all ape-like they were, wild savages.
*   **[[Centralisation]]** - In the end we may be one people remaining, united and miserable.
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - Colonialism and genocide are good friends.
*   **[[Failure to take responsibility]]** - Taking responsibility for those who are dead because of us isn't easy. It's not impossible though. Just inconvenient.
*   **[[Finite games]]** - Play to win. The monks of Tibet might've managed to escape the wheel of samsara but they didn't escape the raining bullets.
*   **[[Hobbesian views]]** - Since, by definition, those who commit genocide are the survivors they will and they must further the views that those who were killed were primitive savages very different from themselves, from us who remain.
*   **[[Illusion of no option]]** - Many genocides are justified through a manufactured narrative of having no other option.
*   **[[Immoral justifications]]** - No justification for genocide is just.
*   **[[Predicaments/Language]]** - How important is the relation to the killing of languages? Languages allow us to think differently and communicate these thoughts differently. How impactful has our history of linguicide and glottophagy been for our present predicaments?
*   **[[Loss of cultural complexity]]** - Graveyards of complexity will stare at the demise of us remaining simpletons.
*   **[[Madness of safety]]** - Better to remove any and all risks.
*   **[[Maximum power principle]]** - Never allow a different people to even come close to acquiring power equal to yours. Smite them down as soon as they start climbing.
*   **[[Migration]]** - Sadly, it is often impossible to escape the extinction of one's own people.
*   **[[Mistreatment of other humans]]** - Believe it or not, genocide is on the side of the spectrum labelled not-so-nice.
*   **[[Modern slavery]]** - Sometimes, the people being killed have an option for escape. Slavery. Perhaps not explicitly. But still.
*   **[[Moloch]]** - Moloch is an avid collector of extinctions. The walls of his domain plastered in over-exposed photographs of extinct rape victims like Playboy foldouts.
*   **[[Monocultures (people)]]** - We will be left with one remaining culture.
*   **[[Naive progress narrative]]** - The people we killed, well, they were miserable, okay? And now they're dead, and they're not miserable. And their land is actually being properly used. All in all, I'd say this was a huge step forward.
*   **[[Polarisation]]** - Interestingly, at this time of ongoing crises, we suddenly have a split in Western societies where it seems people have two sides to choose from: hate jews or hate arabs. Convenient distraction, I'd say.
*   **[[Propaganda]]** - The propagation of the winners' agenda must continue.
*   **[[Violence]]** - Genocide and its justifications will further increase the use of violence to solve problems.
*   **[[War]]** - Genocide is war. War is often genocide. Though, when the jews were killed in gas chambers... What kind of war stops one side from fighting back? I take it back, genocide is not war. But wars are often started because of committed or desired genocides.
