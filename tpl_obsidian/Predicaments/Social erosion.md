**Social erosion, or social cohesion erosion, is the gnawing away and [crumbling of civil society fractured by divergent forces from within](https://www.fastcompany.com/90712209/why-global-leaders-are-terrified-about-social-cohesion-erosion)**. According to a [WEF report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf) it is the risk that has worsened the most since COVID-19. Social cohesion generally means [a sense of togetherness, trust, opportunities, and orientation towards a common goal](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight/social-cohesion-erosion_en). This erosion, similarly to soil erosion, occurs when society is ruled carelessly with incoherent short-term priorities and undue force. Just as soil erosion risks us losing all fertile soil, social erosion risks us losing our society.
