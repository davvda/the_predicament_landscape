**Modern society rests on the discipline of timekeeping**. If you aren't following the time of the clock it will not be possible for you to partake, you will miss everything. Yet, I wonder what we are missing with our minds constantly framed in dates and minutes. When writing this we are currently between Rikka, when birds and frogs start singing the songs of summer, and Shōman, when the plants bloom and the wheat ripens, at least according to the [small seasons of Japan](https://smallseasons.guide/). It is morning but the sun is already high in the sky. The swifts should be arriving any day now, after their long flight from Africa, they'll nest in the eaves of our apartment building. They're somehow always on time, as if they knew our wedding day.

It is estimated that humans started using something akin to clocks 5000-6000 years ago with the purpose of organising time more efficiently, most likely related to formal religions and certain social and societal activities. Modern clock time is globally coordinated across time zones whose main origin is the industrial revolution which brought factories and high-speed transportation that required accurate timekeeping. Similarly to the loss of wholeness of space and matter when only considering atoms, something is lost of the wholeness and flow of time when considering seconds. There is undoubtedly a usefulness in timekeeping but one must ask if this usefulness hasn't peaked way before we started to wake up, not with the sun, but with the [oscillations of quartz crystals or going to sleep with the resonance of cesium atoms](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/29/foer.php).

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - One of the main ways for colonialists and missionaries to judge the level of sophistication of primitive peoples was their timekeeping. Introducing the savages to the mechanical clock time of civilisation was a soft nudge towards the cliff.
*   **[[Lack of a living world view]]** - The ticking of a clock mechanises the world and homogenises all its temporalities.
*   **[[Lack of time]]** - By wanting to keep time we seem to have none of it.
*   **[[Misinformation]]** - Does it sound far-fetched to you? The homogeneous nature of clock time is an all-encompassing ambient misinformation campaign. Time is never the same. What would a salmon gain from knowing the average volumetric flow rate of its stream?
*   **[[Modern slavery]]** - Are you ever not a slave to the clock?
*   **[[Over-reliance on technology]]** - Don't think you're overly reliant on technology to live your life? I challenge you to live a day, a week, or a month without any access to clock time. If this is not a problem for you, send me an email because I'd like to have a chat about how to end up in your situation.
*   **[[Quantification]]** - Quantifying time is fundamental for nearly all other quantification.
*   **[[The minimisation of all things wild]]** - The temporal patterns of nature flow wildly from note to note while we stutter in monotonous staccato.
*   **[[Weber's iron cage]]** - Clock in, clock out.
