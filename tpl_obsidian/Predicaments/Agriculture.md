**Agriculture is the [cultivation and caring for the fields of the Earth](https://www.etymonline.com/word/culture#etymonline_v_452)**, generally with the purpose of providing us with food but also fuels, fibres, and other raw materials. It includes crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry.

The introduction of agricultural practices during the Neolithic revolution more than 10,000 years ago started transitioning most of humanity from a life of hunting and gathering to a settled life of farming. It is not unreasonable to see this as the starting point of many of our predicaments. Even though that may be stating things too simplistically this change in our ways of life undeniably defines much of what life is for us in modern times. Importantly though, the magnitude of this change exploded during the last millennium. A thousand years ago around 4% of Earth's usable land was used for farming. [This number today falls somewhere around 50%](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use). With half of our planet being actively cultivated, our agricultural practices matter greatly.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Access to food]] - Agriculture in its modern form is most likely the reason why you take for granted that you have food to eat. For now.
- [[Access to water]] - Around 70% of all freshwater use is for agricultural practices. Should this be the case? Perhaps. There have been times during wildfires where Californians were asked to refrain from showerin, meanwhile almond plantations still watered their trees, horizon a few miles away a line of fire.
- [[Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight]] - Modern agricultural practices consist of machines driven by ancient sunlight to  extract the energy from old sunlight.
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Our global food system is the primary driver of biodiversity loss, with agriculture alone being the identified threat to 86% of the species at risk of extinction. (ADD SOURCE UN ENV. PROGRAMME)
- [[Carelessness]] - The carelessness with which we flatten forest land to grow corn. Tell me, what will you do carrying this leaden guilt on your shoulders?
- [[Climate change]] - Modern agriculture and climate change are intertwined in so many ways.
- [[Deforestation]] - Efficient mono-crop agriculture resents the complexity of forests. Nothing but open horizons, baby.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - We've tamed nature, bent her to our needs. Let us live like kings.
- [[Desertification]] - Cropland expansion and intensification of agriculture are among the main drivers of desertification.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - In a sense, the agricultural revolution laid out the obvious path we would take towards a global ecological crisis.
- [[Energy]] - Agriculture plays a central role in modernity's energy systems.
- [[Genetic modification]] - Industrial agriculture and GMO are like two peas in a frost-resistant pod.
- [[Ignoring complexity]] - Modern agricultural practices tend to disregard complexity. How resilient is a corn field compared with a forest garden?
- [[Ignoring diversity]] - Modern agricultural practices tend to disregard diversity. How varied is a wheat field compared with an open pasture?
- [[Illusion of competence]] - We keep congratulating ourselves for increasing crop yields, backs turned to the nearby field where the four horses of the apocalypse calmly graze.
- [[Insect loss]] - Insect loss is pretty much one of the explicit goals of industrial agriculture.
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - As with so much we do, the focus is on immediate gain.
- [[Malnutrition]] - Modern agriculture's fetishisation of quantity is contributing to a decrease in nutritional quality. 
- [[Mistreatment of animals]] - Replacing forests with monocrop plantations is an apocalyptic event for the animals of the affected place.
- [[Monocultures (agriculture)]] - Agriculture today is synonymous with monocultures.
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]] - Pesticides find their way into groundwater and even rain clouds.
- [[Population growth]] - There is no denying that modern agricultural practices is one of the main causes of the past centuries' population growth.
- [[Sameness]] - Fields brown in winter, green in summer, accessible only to machines. A homogeneous illusion of openness.
- [[Soil erosion]] - Soil erosion is one of agriculture's toughest enemies. Unfortunately, our agricultural practices are also the main driver of soil erosion. 
- [[The desacration of all places]] - ["The pond appeared to be a success. Before the bulldozer quit work, water had already begun to seep in. Soon there was enough to support a few head of stock. To heal the exposed ground, I fertilized it and sowed it with grass and clover. ... The trouble was the familiar one: too much power, too little knowledge. The fault was mine. ... And yet there is damage - to my place, and to me. I have carried out, before my own eyes and against my intention, a part of the modern tragedy: I have made a lasting flaw in the face of the earth, for no lasting good. Until that wound in the hillside, my place, is healed, there will be something impaired in my mind. My peace is damaged. I will not be able to forget it."](https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1506&context=hastings_environmental_law_journal)
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - We demand control and predictability, something we cannot ask the wild for, so we turn the surface of the Earth into a quilt of controllable calories.
- [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]] - The illusory openness of cropfields makes for a fitting analogy of modernity's lack of commons. You can be and go anywhere except nearly everywhere because it isn't *yours*.
