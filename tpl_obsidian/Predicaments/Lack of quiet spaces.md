> The issue which I propose for discussion should therefore be clear: how to counter the encroachment of new, electronic devices and systems upon commons that are more subtle and more intimate to our being than either grassland or roads - commons that are at least as valuable as silence. Silence, according to western and eastern tradition alike, is necessary for the emergence of persons. It is taken from us by machines that ape people. We could easily be made increasingly dependent on machines for speaking and for thinking, as we are already dependent on machines for moving.

> Ivan Illich, Silence as a Commons

**Few, if any, places remain on our planet that aren't polluted with anthropogenic sounds**. The hum of highways, airplane engines high above, tires ripping hot asphalt, titanium angels cutting clouds. The most profound wisdom lies in the depth of silence, a silence that is going extinct. Every human should have access to a place without human-made sounds, and so should every other animal. In the words of Miles Davis, "it's not the note you play that's the wrong note - it's the note you play afterwards that makes it right or wrong". The unlearning of the modern chaotic cacophony, the notes currently played, can only be made right if what follows is a silence and harmony unbounded.
