**Air travel is the movement of people between different geographical locations using air vehicles**, most commonly airplanes. It is the fastest mode of transportation and it makes, in good ways and bad, the world smaller.

> Away and away the aeroplane shot,  
> till it was nothing but a bright spark; an aspiration;  
> a concentration;  
> a symbol... of man's soul; of his determination...  
> to get outside his body.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Climate change]] - Aviation is estimated to account for [around 4%](https://ourworldindata.org/global-aviation-emissions) of the global warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times.
- [[Globalisation]] - Air travel is a main contributor to globalisation.
- [[Greenwashing]] - Since air travel is notoriously difficult to decarbonise or electrify it has become one of the activities most prone to greenwashing. Taking my kids to Mallorca every year doesn't make me a bad person, does it? The airline we travel with plants a mangrove tree in California for every passenger. 
- [[Hedonism]] - You can go anywhere, do anything, and never be whole.
- [[Lack of quiet spaces]] - There no longer exists a single place on Earth, no matter how secluded, where you're free from the sound of jet engines.
- [[Lack of time]] - The faster we can travel and the more efficiently we can use our time, the less of it we seem to have.
- [[Monocultures (people)]] - Air travel drives the "saming" of the world's cultures.
- [[Out of touch with seasons]] - Bouncing around to avoid the fertile gloom of winter.
- [[Pandemics]] - Viruses and bacteria, having worked millions of years to induce coughing to spread through the air, now find themselves leaning back in jet-propelled metal tubes watching Paddington Bear 2 while we do their job for them.
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]] - Soaring pressurised canisters of poison.
- [[Pollution]] - Jet fuel, deicing chemicals, lead, ozone, ultrafine particles.
- [[Sameness]] - Air travel homogenises the world. You can travel anywhere and experience nothing novel.
- [[The desacration of all places]] - Not even the heavens are sacred.
- [[Transportation infrastructure]] - The fact that airplanes are both faster than other means of transport and can move in three dimensions and not be hindered by oceans or mountains makes the more sane transportation options obsolete. 
- [[Travel]] - Aviation makes it easier to travel and to travel far.
- [[Violence]] - Air travel is the most violent way to move about.
- [[War]] - Air travel and aviation in general has turned wars into games. Would I prefer trenches over impersonal drone strikes? I think I would.
- [[Yuppie dystopia]] - Yes, you too can be a [super-commuter](https://www.skyscanner.com/tips-and-inspiration/flying-to-work).
