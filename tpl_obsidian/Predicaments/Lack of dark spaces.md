I wonder how common it is in the history of humans to feel safer at night when the stars _aren't_ visible. Somehow, I sense an obvious issue in that **the more we brighten the darkness, the more threatening the darkness becomes**, as if we're condensing the beings of darkness, pushing them into the few remaining cramped corners. Unfortunately for us, the less we accept the night, embrace the darkness, the more it seeps into us, corrupts our actions and refracts our rays of thought. Beware the lack of dark spaces, it flatters you not, contorted features, darkened, deepened shadows.
