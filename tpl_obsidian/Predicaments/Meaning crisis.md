One's relationship with the world and one's place in the story of existence dictates how one makes sense of things and what one deems to be meaningful. What happens, then, when our experience of the world becomes increasingly fragmented and incoherent and our roles in the dominating stories become irrelevant or completely cut off from consequence and the flow of time? Nothing has meaning and, by extension, meaning in general does not exist for anyone or anything anywhere. **The meaning crisis is, in short, a lack of meaning that stems from and results in the lack of many other aspects of modern human existence.**
