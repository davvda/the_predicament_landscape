Modern civilisation is, even more than in the past, a fight to be the one singular entity that wins over all others. Cultures are diverse, they should be. Most cultures have deep roots in unique places, traditions, art, literature, myths, peoples, and stories and cultural complexity, the depth and breadth of cultures, is needed for humanity's continued existence. Culture wars that attempt to erase other cultures either with the purpose of one culture "winning" or for one single homogenised culture to swallow all others will reduce humanity's complexity, meaning we'll be decreasingly capable of tackling any challenges we face.

- [[Ignoring diversity]]
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - There are few cultures left. A select few cultures, perhaps one single homogeneous culture, has swallowed or erased all others. All of us born into this culture, we don't even know there used to be radically different colours to every facet of life.
