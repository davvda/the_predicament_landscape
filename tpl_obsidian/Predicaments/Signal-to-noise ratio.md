**[Signal-to-noise ratio is a measure that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio)**. The world manifests itself from our thoughts and attention and our attention is increasingly caught up in rapid rushes of needless noise. This noise is getting so loud that we have lost the ability to detect many of the vital signals in our surroundings and the flow of our own minds.
