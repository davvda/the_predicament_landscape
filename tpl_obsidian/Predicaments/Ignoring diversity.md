> Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilisation.

> Mahatma Gandhi

People, places, cultures, thoughts, opinions, beliefs, systems, values, rights, morals, ethics, are diverse, they're different. **There will never be one way of life for all to follow**, neither should there be. Equality must include diversity to be of value. The only functioning way for all of humanity to be the same is having the freedom to be different, to be diverse. _The next big thing will be many small things_.

> I think... if it is true that there are as many minds as there are heads, then there are as many kinds of love as there are hearts.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Agriculture]] - Different things grow in different places and different things should also grow in each place.
- [[Architecture]] - When all developments optimise similarly they all end up looking the same. Few things are of their place nowadays. I will, despite the negative tone of most predicaments, give an example of an exception, which is some of the newer buildings in central Amsterdam. They manage to be unashamedly modern while blending in with the surrounding buildings which are sometimes several centuries older. At least diversity got to play a part.
- [[Avoiding uncertainty]] - The different is uncertain.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - Almost definitionally. Ignore diverse views and opinions and you've purposefully biased your evidence selection.
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Ignoring biodiversity.
- [[Centralisation]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Non-diverse collectives and systems are fragile.
- [[Predicaments/Craft|Craft]] - The homogenisation of life and its aesthetic components likely facilitated the death of the craft.
- [[Deforestation]] - Being unaware of the diversity of life in an old forest compared with a newly planted one makes deforestation into a non-problem.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - I guess dog breeds are pretty diverse.
- [[Democracy failing]] - What serves the average citizen best when the variance of a globalising population increases? Do you understand what I'm asking? Do I?
- [[Discrimination]]
- [[Ecological crisis]] - Eco-systems flow in time through constant change and diversification. We try, and fail, to impose permanence and sameness.
- [[Educational crisis]] - Turns out, shock surprise, humans aren't homogeneous lumps of plastic able to fill any mold. Is it an unpopular opinion that I don't think anyone should be able to become a doctor or an engineer just because they want to? I mean, I'm an engineer and I definitely shouldn't be one.
- [[Fear]] - The less you understand of the experiences and behaviours of others, especially those deemed *different*, the more probable it is that you fear them.
- [[Finite games]] - Ignoring diversity - that is, not taking differentiation and change into consideration, make infinite games impossible.
- [[Globalisation]] - Globalisation is all-encompassing colonisation by a singular dominating monoculture.
- [[Healthcare]] - When your pathologies fit neatly within the confines of modern healthcare all is well. When you don't, well, there's always acupuncture and Swiss euthanasia.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]] - People like us.
- [[Ignoring complexity]]
- [[Inequality]] - Equal in monotony, other frequencies not included.
- [[Insect loss]] - Honey bees are just great, are they not? Not if they outcompete every other bee, no.
- [[Lack of attentiveness]] - Of course, ignoring something blinds part of your attention. Even when unknowingly ignoring diversity, it narrows your width of attentiveness.
- [[LGBTQ+]]
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - There are times when, if you ignore something, it disappears.
- [[Monocultures (agriculture)]] - An active war on diversity.
- [[Monocultures (people)]]
- [[No respect for indigenous wisdom]] - Other ways of thinking are much too different from our way.
- [[Racism]] - Ignoring or directly opposing diversity.
- [[Sameness]]
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - There are many paths to tread, all of which circle truths.
- [[Sex and sexuality]]
- [[Sexism]] - Hypersexualised sexless androgynous beings in the making?
- [[Simplifications]] - Ignoring diversity makes everything so simple and, unfortunately, all wrong.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Contemplate the myriad things and tell me, wordlessly, what it is you see.
