**All of our energy originally comes from sunlight**. The industrial revolution was in many ways made possible by the extraction and utilisation of stored ancient sunlight in the form of oil. How we choose to divide our usage of ancient, old, and current sunlight is one way of looking at managing our energy predicament.

**Outgoing connections:**
*  [[Acceleration]] - Humanity discovering and extracting ancient sunlight accelerated us through the industrial revolution towards wherever it is we're heading. It is the gas pedal for all of civilisation.
* [[Agriculture]] - The division of different types of sunlight becomes most clear in our modern agricultural practices.
* [[Climate change]] - Climate change is mainly driven by our recent tendency of using more old and ancient sunlight as our major energy sources.
* [[Energy]] - The notion of different types of sunlight provides a useful perspective on our energy predicament.
- [[Finite games]] - We have always known the ancient sunlight was finite, yet we constructed our foundations on its bright promise of infinity.
- [[Greed]] -  "...but even as [it] was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled..." - J.R.R. Tolkien
- [[Growth]] - Ancient sunlight blasted at our economy, it all glints and glimmers so beautifully.
- [[Ignorance of the mythical]] - There exist so many stories, older than time, that warn us to not do what we've now done. 
- [[Ignored externalities]] - In the olympics of ignored externalities I think the fossil fuel industry has a decent chance at a medal.
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - Like Icarus, we're always just sort of winging it.
- [[Resource conflicts]] - The most fought over resource is oil.
- [[Unheeded warnings]] - We keep sippin' that milksheikh in spite of it all.
- [[War]] - Wars are fought over ancient sunlight.
