**A global catastrophic risk or an existential risk is the risk of a hypothetical event that could destroy most or all of humanity** and/or life on Earth occurring. The majority of existing catastrophic risks are anthropogenic, the exceptions being things like asteroid impacts, volcano eruptions, gamma-ray bursts, and the like. Reasoning about catastrophic risks is challenging, the reason for this being that even if the probability of the event is miniscule its consequences are disastrous. Weighing minimal risk with infinitely bad outcome can lead to nonsensical conclusions.
