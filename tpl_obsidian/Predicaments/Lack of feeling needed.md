You are needed. At the very least, if you disagree, you are needed in the sense that you are a part of the world and with the changing of the world there will be a change of you. What you do with and about this change is up to you. Modernity has, however, created the predicament that **few, if any, feel needed**. Maybe there is, at the very ground of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the need to feel needed.
