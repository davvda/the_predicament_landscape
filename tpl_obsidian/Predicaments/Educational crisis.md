> Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the essential, the what is; and to awaken this capacity, in oneself and in others, is education.

> J. Krishnamurti

**[Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills and traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education)** and means _to bring forth_. A crisis of education is therefore the potential or actual failure of this transmission and the failure to bring forth humans with the knowledge, skills, and traits needed to find their way in the world. Informal education's role has decreased while the increased role of formal education has narrowed to the point where much necessary knowledge and understanding requires an unlearning of one's formal education. Education, both formal and informal, is necessary for the prevailing of cultures but its current effects aren't just decreasingly constructive, they're also increasingly destructive.

> Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Apathy]] - Education and schooling might not break all kids fully but it sure affects their ability to care deeply about anything.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - Bullshit educations for bullshit jobs.
- [[Carelessness]]
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - The extreme dissonance between what we're taught and our observations and experiences.
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Most modern education draws deeply from the colonialist narrative and embeds it in its pupils.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - If there is one dominating link for the predicament of educational crises, it is this one. The standard education of modernity surely has its merits but the chasm between what it makes us ready for and what it should be expected to make us ready for is so wide that no formal education at all is likely a better path towards maturity. Even though I say this with confidence I am not certain of the exact reasons. Perhaps it lies in my feeling that schooling narrows the mind, reduces and simplifies, condenses too aggressively, curates and makes everything explicit. All of this leads to a necrosis of the mental musculature that assumes and allows complexity, the implicit, vague or no boundaries, nuanced thinking. The connection between educational crisis and complexity mismatch goes deep and I am barely scratching its surface layer.
- [[Discrimination]]
- [[Disinformation]] - Is it too radical of me to believe that much modern education borders on disinformation?
- [[Emotional crisis]]
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - What does your education implicitly tell you to optimise for?
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]]
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]]
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]] - Keep the subjects separate and compartmentalise your brain. Everything is separate with clear boundaries, never mix things, water and oil.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - We drag children away from their homes, families, and from play in order to... Wait, should we tell them none of what they learn will be useful?
- [[Illusion of competence]] - One of the primary dangers with modern education is that the narrower someone's mind has been made, the more competent they appear. 
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - Schooling does not facilitate understanding.
- [[Ineffective institutions]] - Be taught by an ineffective institution and then graduate in order to work for other ineffective institutions. Why are we ever surprised at our horrible results?
- [[Information isn't knowledge]] - The French revolution was 1789.
- [[Knowledge isn't wisdom]]
- [[Lack of a living world view]]
- [[Lack of balance]] - Okay, for all my critique of modern education and its crises, I do believe that the main problem isn't necessarily what it teaches but what it leaves out. It creates mentally and emotionally unbalanced people with a complete lack of depth and nuance in their view of the world. It does this through atrophying those traits inherent in children which gives them the intuition for the world being infinite, magic, full of wonder, complex, and alive. Mental models that mechanises the world can be useful but what we've done is created a system of teaching which pushes minds into the mechanised model, shuts the lid, and locks them inside.
- [[Lack of empathy]]
- [[Lack of systems thinking]]
- [[Predicaments/Language]] - We're often taught languages before we learn what is meant by right speech.
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - All shall be baked in the same mold.
- [[Map and territory]] - School is filled with years and years of reading maps. How many ever look up from the maps after such conditioning?
- [[Meaning crisis]]
- [[Mental health]]
- [[Misinformation]]
- [[Missing elders]] - We mostly lack real adults who can teach children, truly bring them forward towards maturity.
- [[Monocultures (people)]]
- [[Quantification]]
- [[Reductionism]]
- [[Sameness]]
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Our main apparatus designed to teach sense-making makes sense of absolutely nothing.
- [[Story of separation]]
- [[The death of creative work]]
- [[War]] - The most well-educated person I know who always performed the best academically in all subjects now works developing the radar systems for fighter jets.
- [[Wisdom crisis]]
