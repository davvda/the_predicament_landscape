What does it mean to have a purpose or, perhaps more importantly, to lack purpose? **A purpose is an intention, aim, or goal**. It is something put forth, proposed, something to be kept in view, the proper and unique reason for something's existence. Do you have a purpose? Do humans have a purpose? What about other beings? What about the sun? Whatever one answers to these questions it will shape the world one inhabits, make something of it and with it, and allow for the presence of some purposes and the absence of others. If you share humanity's lack of purpose in general, maybe there is a meta-purpose in living with the question of what the proper reason for one's own and humanity's existence could be?
