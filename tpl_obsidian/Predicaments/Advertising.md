Advertisements try to [turn us and direct us](https://www.etymonline.com/word/advertisement) towards something, to affect our awareness of the world around us, generally with the purpose of having us buy or want something. **[Advertising is the practice employed to bring attention to a product or service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising)** It strains the imagination to think of a society without advertising. 

> It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase.
