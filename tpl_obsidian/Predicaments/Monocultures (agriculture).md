Agricultural monocultures, or the practice of monocropping, **means growing the same crop on the same land year after year**. The main reasons for monocropping is the potential overall profitability, productivity, and efficiency. Another important reason for monocropping is predictability. When timber came from planted rows of trees instead of complex forests it became much easier to calculate current and future yields. Like many other predicaments agricultural monocultures provide potential short-term benefits while likely resulting in long-term cascades of problems.
