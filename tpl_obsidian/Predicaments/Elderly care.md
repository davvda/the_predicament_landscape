Older people are useless, a burden on society. They have nothing to contribute with while they leech money, time, and work from us all. Well, yes, because we make them useless and, trust me, they would like nothing more than to contribute and be of use while living a life of leisure and rest after years of labour. Many cultures refer to older people as elders and the contribution of the elders was often caring for and passing on knowledge and wisdom to the younger people, and particularly the children, of the culture, deepening the cultural roots of the people, making sure the chain of wisdom stretching to the beginning of time never broke.

**Modernity leaves older people alone in their homes until death comes knocking**, relatives perhaps visiting when they happen to be in the area, if they have relatives, or in old folk's homes tended to by underpaid nurses and apathetic youngsters.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - Is this what people should get after a long life of work and struggles? If we are so advanced, virtuous, wise, and clever... Why are our elderly sitting in their own shit waiting for their memories to fade while ringing the bell for an overworked and underpaid adolescent to come and aid them?
- [[Dealing with death]] - Elderly care has advanced past death. We live lives wholly absent of grace and we can't even die with it.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - Who should be caring for our elderly?
- [[Healthcare]] - A clear example of how we aim for mastery of death and ignorance of health.
- [[Illusion of no option]] - Where else should the elderly go? Into the homes of their working kids and grandkids? Oh, please. What do you think this is? A charity organisation?
- [[Imprisonment]] - Retirement homes. Soft prisons for useless people who refuse to die. Or so we act.
- [[Lack of belonging]]
- [[Lack of love]] - Do not expect any return of investment for any love you've given in your life to be given back when you're in a retirement home.
- [[Loneliness]]
- [[Madness of safety]] - Keep the elderly in places where they can do no harm and where they won't want to.
- [[Malnutrition]]
- [[Meaning crisis]] - What happens when those who have found their meaning in their work suddenly retire and become useless, their lives suddenly appearing meaningless? Looking directly at my family, the answer seems to be cancer.
- [[Mental health]] - The generations currently most firmly indoctrinated to refuse any acknowledgement of mental illness are probably the ones in the deepest mental troubles.
- [[Missing elders]]
- [[Mistreatment of other humans]]
- [[Only 'can we' never 'should we']] - Can we keep people alive for decades longer than we... should? We're developing elderly- and healthcare on the shoulders of giants and the shoulds of midgets.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]]
- [[Population growth]] - Older and older.
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]]
- [[Surveillance]] - Surveilled for their own sake?
- [[Unpaid important labour]] - A slightly different take on this connection. The predicament of unpaid important labour largely talks about the fact that much important labour goes unpaid. Now, that isn't necessarily an issue. The issue is that we're so incentivised to exclusively focus on that which pays monetarily. What happens, then, is that all labour that isn't paid ends up being passed to someone who can get paid for it. So we end up in a world where a working person caring for their children or their aging parents is making a mistake in the system wherein they live. The correct choice, the incentivised option, is to offload all unpaid work to someone else. So, in short, the most important labour, most frequently the labour associated with love and care, is disincentivised and unpaid and offloaded to someone who can get the same work done but without the actual love and care. Highly efficient, benevolent hell.
- [[Waste]] - The elderly are treated as if their living human waste.
