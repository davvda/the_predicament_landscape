**A myth is a narrative that plays a fundamental role in a culture**. The ongoing narrative is largely based on the myth of the ascent of humanity, the narrative of progress and separation. It is generally not talked about that myths control much of the underlying dynamics of our civilisation. Myths are often fictions told as vaguely historical stories that explain how, why, and what the world is, has become, and/or will end. Forget our fundamental myths and you might just confuse them with reality.

> Myth is promiscuous, not dogmatic. It moves like a lively river through swarthy packs of reindeer, great aristocratic families, and the wild gestures of an Iranian carpet seller. Myth is not much to do with the past, but a kind of magical present that can flood our lives when the conditions are just so. It is not just the neurosis of us humans trying to fathom our place on earth, but sometimes the earth actually speaking back to us. That's why some stories can be hard to approach, they are not necessarily formed from a human point of view.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight]] - How many myths center around the notion of delving too greedily and too deep for unmatched power?
- [[Culture wars]] - What ingrained myths laid the foundations of our few remaining cultures?
- [[Dealing with death]] - Myths help us deal with the unfathomable and that which escapes simple explanation.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - In our modern Gilgamesh tale, there isn't a single cedar left standing.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - Which myths and legends stayed people's actions from completely ruining the land they stood on?
- [[Educational crisis]] - Don't sneer. For many millennia, myths were central to educating the young.
- [[Ego]] - Our Narcissus has long since drowned and sunk into sediment.
- [[End of history]] - How far into the rolling credits are we at this point? Or, fuck me, is this a spin-off?
- [[Evil]] - We don't know it when we see it.
- [[Exponential technology]] - Have you heard the one about the kettle that, when turned on, would boil endless amounts of porridge? No? Well, the gist of the story is that they managed to turn it on but never turn it off. And that's just porridge. I love porridge. We might be dealing with synthetic viruses or artificially generated porn.
- [[Genetic modification]] - Did you know that the Norwegian prince that got sentenced for rape and shit was the result of an experiment where they jumbled around the genomes of frogs so that they'd slowly turn into humans after being kissed by a damsel in distress? Yeah, I didn't believe it either but Norwegians sure are wacky. I believe the researchers blamed the results on the fact that the recruited damsels were underage refugees.
- [[Greed]] - Nostradamus didn't predict anything. We're just too ignorant of the repeating follies of myths. 
- [[Growth]] - The tree that grows too tall too quickly will not withstand any storm.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - I'll be honest, it is almost comical how our circumstances are such ridiculous caricatures of the circumstances in all stories of collapse. 
- [[Lack of a living world view]] - Most myths speak of a world very much alive.
- [[Lack of historical insight]] - Myths are not simply fantasies told for the purpose of entertainment.
- [[Lack of humility]] - To the Gods, we are barely ants under the magnifying glass.
- [[Lack of masculine and feminine]] - Myths have frequently served roles in initiating people into manhood or womanhood. Which popular characters do you see having filled this void? 
- [[Lack of time]] - Myths open up time.
- [[Lack of visions]] - Myths provied alternative ways.
- [[Material extraction]] - "Oh, not these guys again..." - The Balrog of Morgoth
- [[Meaning crisis]] - Where would you place yourself in the lived myth of today? Who would you like to be? If you knew your part played a role in directing the story, what would you do?
- [[No respect for indigenous wisdom]] - In our modern culture, a myth is simply something that isn't real. Are we so intellectually and emotionally impoverished?
- [[Scientism]] - Mythbusters.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Myths can be bridges across unexplainable cracks. Or, sometimes, the myth is the main road or even the entire landscape.
- [[Spiritual metacrisis]] - Myths are often entryways to the spiritual.
- [[Story of separation]] - When we become ignorant of myths and stories we become blind to the stories we're in the middle of. And that, in itself, becomes a vital part in those stories.
- [[Unbalanced longtermism]] - "I want to live forever" - every villian in every story ever, also every disgustingly wealthy person today. Just a coincidence, I'm sure. Why would you want to live forever when you're obviously spending all your time in such horrendous company, being you?
- [[Unheeded warnings]] - Fires, locusts, floods, hmm, no... No, that doesn't ring a bell.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Consider some myths more real than much of what you instinctively consider to be reality. Wisdom lies closer to the heart than to the mind and our ignorance of myths stems largely from only hearing myths through our minds when they actually speak to our hearts.
