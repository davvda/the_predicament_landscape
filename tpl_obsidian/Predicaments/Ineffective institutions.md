Why are institutions failing to manage our predicaments? Their existence has been made possible through many of the same mechanisms that have spawned the predicaments in the first place, meaning their only possible actions are within the dominating systems. Since **the institutions must work within the boundaries of the systems they lack the ability to change the systems**. As long as our institutions have obligations to serve specific economic and political interests there will not be any systemic change that allows for the effective management of our predicaments.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - Not only must modern institutions work within the current system's boundaries, they must and will strive to work and act in its very center, committed to the most system-upholding, system-representing behaviour.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - Have you developed your bullshit intolerance yet?
- [[Bureaucracy]] - K never reaches the castle.
- [[Business-as-usual narrative]]
- [[Democracy failing]] - The will of the people, through the institutional systems, diluted to a weak lotus root tea, forgotten in the corner of a kitchen in city hall, next to a Smeg electric kettle in desperate need of descaling.
- [[Despair]]
- [[Directionlessness]] - Not quite. The purpose of modern institutions is to maintain course. Course to where? I'll have to ask my manager.
- [[Educational systems]]
- [[Government]] - Don't look to your government or institutions to do anything about anything.
- [[Healthcare]]
- [[Illusion of competence]] - Not sure about this. Do institutions believe themselves to be competent?
- [[Inertia]] - That's their purpose.
- [[Lack of agency]] - Never trust an institution to accomplish what you yourself cannot.
- [[Lack of faith in anything]]
- [[Lack of resilient systems]] - Or perhaps modern institutions show great resilience when viewed in isolation? No, resilience and constancy are rarely compatible.
- [[Poverty]]
- [[Predicaments/Public transport|Public transport]] - By Friday, please hand in a three page essay on why public transport should be free, including at least one reason why you think it isn't. Class dismissed.
- [[Slow change]] - The predicaments relating to institutions and governments point to a fascinating contrast in the landscape. Whereas many predicaments of modernity arise from things changing too fast in the wrong direction, unflinchingly and uncritically, the institutionally related predicaments illustrate a lack of change and an impossibility to gain momentum in any meaningful direction. One must stop and wonder if the failings of modern institutions to adequately respond to our situation is based in their very marrow and bones or if their spineless nature has been hijacked, hoisted and animated by the techno-optimistic accelerationist capitalist machine. What do you think?
- [[The impossibility of UBI]] - Our institutions must adhere to the growth incentive and therefore increase wealth at any cost, even at the cost of welfare.
- [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]] - Our institutions, whores whose loose morals are swayed by the faintest silver scent. What most of us engage in daily is sometimes called consentual non-consent. Stay puckered, folk.
- [[Transportation infrastructure]]
