**[Identity is the set of qualities, beliefs, personality traits, appearance, and/or expressions that characterise a person or a group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)**. Identity politics has become one of the western world's biggest distraction. Interestingly, a focus on identity can bring one closer together to people and makes one's societal interconnectedness obvious. Identity in this case moves people away from individualism and towards something akin to collectivism. What makes this more of a predicament than a benefit is that while a focus on identity brings one closer to those whose identities are similar (or identical) to ones own, it moves one further away from everyone else.

- [[Blaming the people]] - Correction: blaming the *other* people.
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Culture wars]]
- [[Democracy failing]] - Identity politics is messing with democracy to a ridiculous extent.

- [[Ego]] - Identity, individualism, and ego seem strongly bound together.
- [[Fear]] - Strong identity within the in-group creates fear of anyone outside the group.
- [[Genocide]] - Okay, conspiracy time. Hear me out. If I was a global leader worried about people actively threatening my rule through their will to combat climate change, work towards another economic system etc etc... If I found their weakness to be identity politics there is one clear solution. That solution? Israel and Palestine. You will easily create an identity mess where normal people suddenly find themselves rooting for Zionism or becoming antisemites, or cheering for Hamas or desiring the complete extermination of all muslims. Great job, world leaders, on manufacturing an all-encompassing identity war, the distraction to end all distractions.
