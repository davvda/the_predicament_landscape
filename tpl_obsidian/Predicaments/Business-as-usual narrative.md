We've made it this far along this path so why should there be any reason to leave it and stray into the wild? It has given us so much, can't you see, we just need to manage inflation a bit more, calm things down in the Middle East, and move our data to the cloud and then the economy kicks back in and all will be sunshine and continued glory, be a bit realistic! If it isn't that clearly stated there is at least an undercurrent in many people's behaviour that **there is no other option than to continue.** Business as usual. Except nothing about our modern day business is usual. Most of the things we do are moments of profound strangeness compared to all of human history. Withholding judgements of our acts as good or bad, simply that they are highly unusual.

Our business-as-usual narrative takes for granted that things will continue indefinitely the same way they've been for a tiny part of human history, extrapolating from almost nothing. Many curves of human impact are verticalising, meaning their exponentiality is becoming obvious, and there is nothing business-as-usual about exponential events. Business-as-usual is dead and gone and the sooner we act like it the better.

- [[Artificial intelligence]] - The smoldering desire to have everything comtinue is one of the main drivers of pushing the development of artificial intelligence. An artificial fertiliser for our business processes.

- [[Capitalism]] - Busyness-as-usual.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]] - Through carbon accounting we can continue doing exactly what we've been doing but with the appearance of doing something else.
- [[Climate footprints]] - Treading lightly with steeltoed leather boots.
- [[Clock time]] - Business around the clock, deals timed to milliseconds. Imagine living one day in a socity without clock time. What real problems can you see? Would you die?
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - All part of a similar narrative.
- [[Consumerism]]
- [[Debt]]
- [[Directionlessness]] - The business-as-usual narrative has one direction: forward... Or maybe up? Actually, it doesn't does it? It has speed but no velocity.
- [[Distractions]] - Don't look. Mute all astonishment.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - Nothing in the world is continuing as usual.
- [[Educational crisis]] - Here I am, a stupid hippie, thinking children should learn how to grow food, how to care for others, how to forage, how to think, how to teach, how to live, how to build, how to grow, and here we all are, one year telling them all to learn coding and the next to give up coding because of LLMs. Just keep to the regular curriculum.
- [[Electric vehicle solutions]] - We want to keep doing what we do no matter what the cost.
- [[Energy]]
- [[Energy consumption increasing]]
- [[Evil]] - The business-as-usual narrative is, when looked at through any critical lens, a narrative of justifying the necessary evils of modernity.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]]
- [[Finite games]]
- [[Global supply chains]]
- [[Government]] - Governments are no longer distinguishable from the business side of society. The only way to get votes is to run a campaign along the business-as-usual narrative or a pretend narrative of return-to-business-as-usual.
- [[Greenwashing]] - Look, the new and improved vehicle of modernity is entirely different, it's green. And it's got collision sensors. They kept going off though so I deactivated them until I can get them looked at.

- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]]
- [[Ignored externalities]] - The business cannot continue if externalities are internalised.

- [[Inertia]]
- [[Investing]] - I think you could expect an average return of around 17% every year for the coming 20 years or so. Well, yes, I guess it technically is crypto but it's slightly different.
- [[Lack of feeling needed]]
- [[Lack of purpose]]
- [[Lack of systems thinking]]
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - I love that people still talk about the Paris agreement, where nations decided that we need to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. We simply said so, we decided it. Yet, we smashed through that decision in 2024 and still I see reports citing the importance of sticking to the Paris agreement. Balls deep in hooker cunt we swear loyalty to our wife.
- [[Lack of visions]] - Business-as-usual no longer has any visions.
- [[Lobbyism]]
