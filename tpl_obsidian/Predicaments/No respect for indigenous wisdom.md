Many indigenous peoples have (or had) existed for a nearly unimaginably long time, often in harmony with their surroundings and living fairly peaceful lives, especially when considering peace and violence in a broader sense. There are, of course, exceptions. **Most indigenous wisdom will appear quite foreign and nonsensical to most westerners, both less and more abstract, less and more real**. The strangeness of their wisdom and the exceptions where violence and brutishness was the norm has nearly led to an extinction of indigenous wisdom traditions and a complete lack of respect for it.
