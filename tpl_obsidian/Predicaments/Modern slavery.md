> I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceased to be a man.

It is estimated that there are about 50 million people living in conditions of modern slavery. Modern slavery is, according to [Walk Free](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/#the-scale), "**situations of exploitation that a person cannot refuse or leave because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception**". I would, with this definition in mind, potentially increase their estimate quite a bit but let it be enough to say that slavery is not a thing of the past, it might even be at its historical peak.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Addiction]]** - Keep people addicted and they will keep their eyes on the prize rather than the conditions required to get it.
*   **[[Avoiding radical options]]** - What, do you honestly mean we should let them spend their time as they see fit? Are you insane?
*   **[[Avoiding uncertainty]]** - Keep people working, keep them returning to the same place, tire them out, create mental shackles, that way you never have to be fearful of what they choose to do. They've forgotten how to choose.
*   **[[Biased evidence selection]]** - Modern slavery must be constantly justified by the few metrics we've deemed as unquestionable good. They've been saved from poverty, they're contributing to growth, productivity is at an all time high.
*   **[[Bullshit jobs]]** - Modern slavery in the west often takes the form of bullshit jobs. How much of your job would you say is absolutely necessary for yourself or others? Stop reshuffling those documents.
*   **[[Capitalism]]** - Modern slavery is the fundamental driver of capitalism. Not the machines, the humans the machines are built of.
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - Surely, if this village went from no GDP to any GDP that would be infinitely positive?
*   **[[Consumerism]]** - Slave labour is cheap so therefore its products are cheaper. Consume away.
*   **[[Debt]]** - Debt is one of the main threats and enforcers of modern slavery.
*   **[[Discrimination]]** - Some people obviously do better in slave-like conditions than others. No?
*   **[[Dispositionism]]** - The people mentioned above, well, they simply are that way, see?
*   **[[Emotional crisis]]** - What do you feel when you think deeply about this?
*   **[[Failure to take responsibility]]** - How can companies and nations take responsibility for all of the explicit, implicit, obvious, and hidden slavery required for their alleged thriving? How can you as a person take responsibility for who dyed your shirt? Donations? Prayers? A gratitude journal?
*   **[[Globalisation]]** - Slavery has been a successful method of globalisation.
*   **[[Growth]]** - Modern slave labour drives growth.
*   **[[Illusion of no option]]** - If slave labour drives growth and we must grow to continue, then we must keep slaving away. There is no other way.
*   **[[Immoral justifications]]** - What can justify the wasting away of other lives for no clear real purpose?
*   **[[Inequality]]** - The harshness of the conditions of slavery often depends on the slave.
*   **[[Lack of communities]]** - Modern slavery drags people out of local communities and into the churning of the global machine.
*   **[[Lack of time]]** - Work to do, no time to think, to reconsider, to live a little. The best mothers are never home. How else will their children afford an education to be different slaves slightly higher up the ladder?
*   **[[Laws]]** - Laws are boundaries set for many slave-like conditions.
*   **[[Material extraction]]** - Slavery lies in all parts of the supply chain but perhaps the ones who are worst off are the slaves working with material extraction.
*   **[[Meaning crisis]]** - What meaning does life have for a slave? The meaning of the slave's existence is not for the slave to ponder.
*   **[[Mistreatment of animals]]** - Domesticated animals that aren't eaten are used for milk, eggs, entertainment, work, generally slave-liked existences.
*   **[[Mistreatment of other humans]]** - Modern slavery is and further increases mistreatment of humans.
*   **[[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]]** - They like being slaves.
*   **[[Poverty]]** - Modern slavery is what saves people from poverty by introducing them into the concept known as poverty.
*   **[[Resources]]** - The modern slavery that most obviously resembles the traditional view of slavery is the conditions of those manually extracting resources from the Earth.
*   **[[Status]]** - Convince some slaves they've climbed higher than others and they might be motivated to keep climbing for generations.
*   **[[Unemployment]]** - I'm not sure how many times I'll write this but the fact that unemployment is exclusively seen as a negative metric is so ridiculous I don't even know what more to say. Since the dawn of industry we should've focused on achieving as close to 100% unemployment as possible.
*   **[[Views on human nature]]** - Without someone telling these people what to do they simply wouldn't do anything, right?
*   **[[Violence]]** - Violence is the boundary set around slavery. If we define violence as Bohm does it, namely as any act that uses undue force, then there are very few truly free people.
*   **[[Weber's iron cage]]** - The iron cage is slavery.
