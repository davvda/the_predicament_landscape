The Potawatomi language consists of around 70% verbs compared to 30% in the English language. Why would that matter? The world of the Potawatomi is alive, being, doing, becoming. The world of English consists mostly of static things, inanimate objects. There is a lot to language, especially since **the language we learn as children tends to be the language that structures and leads our thoughts for the rest of our lives**. It is also nearly impossible to escape the frames of one's language in imagination and thinking processes.
