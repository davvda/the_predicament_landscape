**Big tech refers to a select few corporations that control a large part of the world's technological development**, usually within the IT-sector. The impact these corporations can have makes them more powerful than many nations. They are in control of our attention, information, social interaction, and are in some ways the final expression of the spectacle that is modern capitalism. Avoid big tech completely and it becomes nearly impossible to be a citizen of modernity.
