> Wear your ego like a loose fitting garment.
> 
> Gautama Buddha

The ego, the small self, the self-centered illusory center-self, the motivator of self-serving actions, the "I" that wants and desires, the separate "me", the voice that asks "what's in it for me?", the mental chatter you think is yours and you. **The ego claims to be and justifies _the self_**. Ego dynamics lie at the bottom of many predicaments and, if we don't learn to understand the ego for what it is, it will rule us to ruin.
