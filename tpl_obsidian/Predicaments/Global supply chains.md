Look around at the objects around you and try to figure out how many parts of the world have been involved in the production of those objects. **Global supply chains are spread out across the world and include the flow of information, processes, and resources.**

**Fragile global supply chains are sensitive to disruptions**. The COVID-19 pandemic showed clearly the lack of resilience of modern day global supply chains. As our civilisation tries to weather transition and collapse these low-probability high-impact events are likely to occur more often risking even larger disruptions to global supply chains.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]] - As long as it all works, it works faster and faster. 
- [[Access to food]]
- [[Air travel]] - Air freight.
- [[Capitalism]]
- [[Car-centric design]] - Roads are as much or more about transporting goods than transporting people.
- [[Cars]] - The red blood cells of our economy?
- [[Clock time]] - The world must be acting in one and the same temporal system to be able to coordinate. 
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Global supply chains is a great concealer of ongoing colonialism.
- [[Consumerism]]
- [[Cost of living]] - Interesting connection. Whose cost of living is lowered and who pays the real cost?
- [[Predicaments/Craft|Craft]] - I wonder what a pair of locally handmade denim jeans would cost me.
- [[Globalisation]] - The key to globalisation.
- [[Growth]]
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]] - Most goods are transported from poor to rich countries. Logically, or perhaps naively distributist, one would guess the opposite.
- [[Ignored externalities]] - When the most reasonable option is to have material from one continent, manufacturing in another, chemical treatment in yet another, and then rapid consumption followed by landfill... What's going on?
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]]
- [[Modern slavery]] - The slaves of modernity often work far away from their masters.
- [[Monocultures (people)]] - We are free to be whoever we are through our purchases and we all wear the same brands.
- [[Nothing is local]] - Global supply chains are one of the main reasons why few places are locally sustainable.
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]]
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]]
- [[Pollution]]
- [[Profit]] - Global supply chains are, of course, profitable.
- [[Sameness]]
- [[Status]] - Status and class, when all have access to the same goods, becomes universal and globally comparable.
- [[Sustainable growth]] - Countries such as Sweden can boast ever more sustainable growth while offloading emission-intensive processes to the global supply chain. Let other people choke on the fumes.
- [[Traffic noise]]
- [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]] - Anything that can be swallowed up by capitalism...
- [[Transportation infrastructure]] - Not only is our infrastructure designed more for motor vehicles than for humans, it is designed for motor vehicles moving stuff rather than humans.
- [[Waste]]
