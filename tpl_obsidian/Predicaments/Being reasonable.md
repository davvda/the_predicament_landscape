**To be reasonable is, or rather should be, to think through and to understand**. Most features of our predicament landscape have arisen due to our commitment to (try to) be reasonable. Unreasonably reasonable. To stop deforestation is not seen as reasonable, to [cut down most of the old growth forests](https://theconversation.com/sweden-has-vast-old-growth-forests-but-they-are-being-chopped-down-faster-than-the-amazon-218753) apparently is. Reasoning has its merits but it seems we must dare to be a bit unreasonable to be able to manage our modern predicaments. All reasoning tends to follow a certain optimisation and prioritisation and if we haven't figured out what to optimise for (meta-optimisation) our reasoning has little value.

**Outgoing connections:**

- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - The left hemisphere deals with narrow reasoning, unaware of how narrow it is.
- [[Ignorance of the mystical]] - You cannot reason with the mystical.

- [[Illusion of no option]] - Sticking to a path that seems reasonable in a landscape made largely unreasonable becomes a struggle to stay on the path that promised us the future, with no reasonable options remaining to actually get there.
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - Reason has little to do with understanding. They are distant relatives.
- [[Immoral justifications]] - Someone skilled in reasoning can justify anything.
- [[Map and territory]] - You do not reason with reality, but you're free to doodle on the map as much as you like.
- [[Mind-body separation]] - Reasonable people tend to think they're a brain living inside of a body.

- [[Scientism]] - The religion of reason has become scientism.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Reason is not sufficient to make sense of our predicament.
- [[Simplifications]] - Reasoning needs simplified models to make sense of the world.
