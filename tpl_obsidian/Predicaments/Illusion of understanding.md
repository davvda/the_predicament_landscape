To understand is to have a deeply rooted foundation **under**neath where one **stands**. True **understanding cannot be explained or boiled down to concepts or models**, they only reach the shallow top layer. True understanding and the understanding of truths lies beyond the verbal and explainable. Modern civilisation is, unfortunately, unknowingly, constantly conflating explanations with understanding. 

As a predicament, the illusion of understanding presents us with a world that never makes real sense with the explanations we have, it doesn't behave the way we expect or want. In short, everything is infinitely more complex than we can know, and because it is comforting and often useful to place the world within the frames of concepts, models, principles, and laws, we end up with an illusion of understanding the world, missing that it stretches outside of the frames, endlessly in all directions.

- [[Artificial intelligence]] - Can an artificial intelligence ever understand anything? Much of our modern inability to understand comes from an artificialisation of our own intelligence.
- [[Being reasonable]] - “The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth.” - Niels Bohr. Reason only gets you so far, unless reason is the furthest you think you can go.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]]
- [[Climate footprints]]
- [[Clock time]] - If you think life is passing by too fast, get down into a plank position and savour the bending of space-time.
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Every model eventually has to face the workings of reality.
- [[Dogmatism]]
- [[Educational crisis]] - Ideas lacking foundations are the easiest to propagate.
- [[Electric vehicle solutions]]
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - Am I giving too much credit by assuming that most people believe they understand? Do people even care if they understand or not?
- [[Healthcare]]
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - Left hemisphere strikes again. Devious li'l bastard.
- [[Hobbesian views]]
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]] - Perhaps the strongest connection for this predicament. With our ways of explaining, modelling, framing, and consequently reducing all knowledge to fit within these frames, we lose the whole, the interconnectedness of what we believe we understand. The deeply rooted foundations I mention can often be the very connections between all things, every thought and idea rooted in the whole.
- [[Ignored externalities]]
- [[Ignoring complexity]]
- [[Illusion of competence]]
- [[Lack of humility]] - I'm not sure I've understood anything. Have you?
- [[Map and territory]]
- [[Misinformation]] - Now that I really think about it, it is mostly impossible to transmit true understanding. Eat your porridge and wash your bowl.
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Do you understand progress?
- [[Naive techno-optimism]] - Do you understand the role of technology?
- [[Naive techno-pessimism]] - Do you understand the role of technology, really?
- [[Rationalism]] - Has nothing to do with understanding. You might be *less wrong* but being more right isn't on the same path. Also, apologies for this, most aspiring rationalists, autistic people aside, you'll just progressively become more of an asshole.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - One key disappointment of growing up is the shattering of the idea that grown-up people understand everything, or anything, literally any one thing at all.
- [[Simplifications]]
- [[Solutionism]] - If you do not understand the problem, you can never solve it. Now, repeat that with emphasis on *understand the problem* and reflect on the solutions you see around you. Modern healthcare is at times a marvel that saves lives. What healthcare interventions show deep understanding of the underlying problems?
