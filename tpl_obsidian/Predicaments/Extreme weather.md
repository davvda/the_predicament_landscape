**Extreme weather is any weather condition at the extremes of whatever has been observed and recorded in the past** and includes heat waves, cold waves, storms, etc.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as "an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations."

Human activity is most likely the main driver of the increased frequency of extreme weather events.

Extreme weather can also act as warnings and omens. Will we listen?

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Access to food]]** - Farmers are dependent on the weather for good harvests.
*   **[[Access to water]]** - Both droughts and floods will increase but less evenly distributed.
*   **[[Agriculture]]** - Weather conditions will always affect how we produce our food.
*   **[[Big tech]]** - The more volatile the weather systems become, the more likely that companies try to capitalise on geoengineering projects to stabilise the weather through technology.
*   **[[Biodiversity loss]]** - The weather is changing faster than many species can adapt to.
*   **[[Cognitive dissonance]]** - People in places that are less negatively affected by extreme weather will have issues with understanding what the problem is. For example, hotter and longer summers in Sweden? Sign me up!
*   **[[Desertification]]** - Rainfall or lack of it can both lead to desertification.
*   **[[Ecological crisis]]** - Extreme weather conditions are some of the clearest and most obvious factors for humans in the ecological crisis. Floods, heat weaves, temperature records, snow, unusual weather phenomena are all directly lived and experienced. How loud will the sirens have to be for the warnings to be heard?
*   **[[Energy consumption increasing]]** - As outside temperatures vary we prefer inside temperatures to stay stable. Turn up the AC, will you, love?
*   **[[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]]** - Poorer countries somewhere else will take the first hits from extreme weather. When our ACs break it'll be too late for us.
*   **[[Insect loss]]** - The weather is changing faster than many insect species can adapt to.
*   **[[Lack of humility]]** - Humanity might suddenly have to come to terms with just how small we are.
*   **[[Mass climate migration]]** - Droughts, floods, and the short fuse of the heavens will force many people to leave their homes.
*   **[[Moloch]]** - Moloch does not rust, his horns pierce the sky, he is flame and quake, flood and pest.
*   **[[Out of touch with seasons]]** - [Can you paint spring without painting plums and peaches?](https://wisdomtrove.com/author_quotes/dogen-quotes/)
*   **[[Poverty]]** - Instable weather conditions can push people into poverty.
*   **[[Resource conflicts]]** - As weather-dependent resources become less evenly distributed, we will see increases in resource conflicts.
*   **[[Soil erosion]]** - Extreme weather can cause soil erosion.
*   **[[Unheeded warnings]]** - Can nature be any clearer with its communication?
*   **[[War]]** - Floods, droughts, fires... Wars have been declared over less.
