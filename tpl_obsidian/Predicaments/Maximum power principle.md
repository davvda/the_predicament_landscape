The maximum power principle, as a fourth law of thermodynamics, is used as a principle to quantitatively describe biological evolution as **the maximum rate of useful energy transformation for any biological system**. More simply stated (by A.J. Lotka) "[the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in \[using the energy for\] the preservation of the species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principle)".

Another way of looking at it is that whoever manages to acquire and utilise the most power will live. Those who don't won't.
