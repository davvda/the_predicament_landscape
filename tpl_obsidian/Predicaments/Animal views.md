The Abrahamic religions put us, contrary to most spiritual precedents, in a garden where animals then followed, placed alongside us to be in our service. These religions didn't necessarily initiate this view but they contain clear mythologies of our historical thinking.

As our civilisation has become increasingly sophisticated (bunny ears on that one, I suppose) our views on other animals have become increasingly barbaric. It is important to note that the animal rights movement isn't something new. Jainism and its concept of ahimsa (refraining from the destruction of life) is around 3000 years old and animistic traditions reach back to, and might even in some ways precede, the rise of humans. **Different animal views than ours are not just possible, they're historically more common and less complicated to justify**.

**Outgoing connections:**
* [[Carelessness]] - The way we view animals makes all care seem pointless.
* [[Cognitive dissonance]] - How does anyone believe they are good when dependent on this web of slaughter and extinctions?
* [[Educational crisis]] - After we stop learning that the cow says moo we're kept in the dark. Better that way. Else we might start a revolution.
* [[Emotional crisis]] - Unprofessional of me to get personal here but other people's animal views can sometimes break me completely. 
* [[Industrial slaughter]] - Our animal views are necessary for industrial slaughter. See living beings as machines, monsters, or both, and no laws or morals can touch your vile existence.
* [[Lack of a living world view]] - In order to justify our systemic killing we've had to make sure our animals views already see everything as dead.
* [[Lack of compassion]] - Compassion, in relation to our animal views, is a concept so foreign it wouldn't even register as a possibility.
* [[Lack of empathy]] - A sign of weakness? Do wolves feel their prey's pain? I'm not sure you're allowed to use that example when aortastenosis and diabetes are your pathways of empathy for those whose flesh you've eaten.
* [[Mistreatment of animals]] - Of course, our views of them facilitates our mistreatment of them.
* [[Views on human nature]] - We're animals after all, aren't we?
* [[Wisdom crisis]] - We are so ridiculously, terribly, fantastically, fucking disgustingly unwise.
