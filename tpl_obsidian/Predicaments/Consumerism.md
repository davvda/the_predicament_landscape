Consuming means [using up](https://www.etymonline.com/word/consume). **Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the aspirations of individuals include using up more than is necessary for survival**. Consumerism is mainly the result of free markets and the notion that **[the free choice of the consumers is what should orient the economic organisation of a society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism)**. Coincidentally, this gives companies a clear reason to blame the consumers for any externalities caused in the production of the products and services the consumers want and need. It isn't the companies fault that they just follow the will of the people, right?

**Outgoing connections:**
* [[Advertising]] - Can someone explain to me how and when it became fashionable to dress like a billboard? Are we so starved for attention and appreciation that we happily tattoo our favourite brands on our foreheads to cement who we truly are? Brands have managed to make *us* pay to market their products through consumption and identity-strengthening flaunting.
* [[Blaming the people]] - It is the consumer's fault that they want what they want.
* [[Business-as-usual narrative]]
* [[Capitalism]]
* [[Chasing happiness]] - The path to happiness is paved with purchases.
* [[Debt]]
* [[Distractions]]
* [[Ego]]
* [[Global supply chains]]
* [[Greed]]
* [[Hedonism]]
* [[No value in maintenance]] - Easier to buy new than to mend, maintain, repair, or care for. Often cheaper too.
* [[Populations entering the 'middle class']] - Entering the middle class is often a hierarchical step in purchasing power and freedom to unthinkingly consume.
* [[Poverty]] - Poor people in the west tend to have the latest smartphone and manicured nails.
* [[Resources]] - Utter carelessness for the finite resources of our planet. We'll be talked about as despicable demons of unthinking greed in future myths, if anyone remains to tell them.
* [[Sex and sexuality]] - Sex sells. 
* [[Status]] - I'll just say it. If you own golf clubs, close this page and give up. You can try again in another life.
* [[Virtue signalling]] - We purchase things that signal outwardly who we are, how good we are. 10% of the profit made from my sweatshirt goes to surgery for Kazakh mountain goats who have torn their anterior cruciate ligament. Yes, it is a very noble cause, I'm happy that I can contribute in some way, they deserve better, a second chance.
* [[Waste]]
* [[Yuppie dystopia]]
