We keep studying human nature in systems that keep causing its corruption.

Most of the time that we blame human nature we should be blaming system dynamics which create conditions for human nature to adapt in a certain way.

Human nature can be many things. It can be unnecessarily violent and cruel and also peaceful and kind. **Human nature is what we make it into**.
