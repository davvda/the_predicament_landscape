**Discrimination is the process of making distinctions between others based on the categories they belong or are perceived to belong to**. It is a furthering of the forcing of separation and division that modernity excels at. 

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Access to food]]
- [[Access to water]]
- [[Addiction]]
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - Often furthering the biases that begun the discriminations to begin with.
- [[Blaming the people]] - Blaming a certain people.
- [[Colonialist narratives]]
- [[Culture wars]]
- [[Dispositionism]] - Dispositionism is often rooted in and driven by acts of discrimination. Unfortunately, the behaviours following these acts frequently deepen the dispositions held by the discriminators, further justifying both the discrimination and the dispositionist view. If you believe a certain type of person is violent and take extra precautions against this violence, enough so that the person feels the world closing in on him, it is likely he'll turn violent. This is a great oppressive strategy that acts to justify unjust rule.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - Should statues of historic discriminators be torn down? Probably. But it won't fix anything. 
- [[Genocide]] - The potential end result of discrimination. 
- [[Identity]] - Why is it so important for the people of modernity to clearly be this, not that, like him, not like her?
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]]
- [[Ignoring diversity]]
- [[Illusion of understanding]]
- [[Immoral justifications]]
- [[Imprisonment]] - How often does the distribution of ethnicity in prisons match the distribution of discriminated ethnicities in that society? What leads to what? How many are discriminated because of inherently criminal tendencies and how many turn to crime because of discrimination? My money is on most prisoners being in the second category. Why did I write "inherently criminal tendencies"? Now, what the hell does that mean? The law is not a law of nature.
- [[Inequality]]
- [[Lack of empathy]]
- [[Predicaments/Language]] - What does it do to our thoughts about people when we exclude those who do not speak English from the discussions? And how does it change them when allowed to be included on the condition that they're translated into English? What is lost? Are you fortunate enough to speak a "non-Western" language? Do you notice a difference between your breadth of thinking compared with a native English-speaker who only speaks English? To take this even further, with the noun-dominance of English I wonder how much our languages are to blame for our discriminatory tendencies...

- [[Violence]] - Dogs will fight viciously when hindered by a leash, bark loudly when stopped by a fence, and since these dogs will never run free, we'll never know their real nature.
