> And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

Imagine, for a moment, that we suddenly were able to manage all of the predicaments in the landscape, that we somehow solved all of our problems and helped the Earth recover. The time preceding this moment will, I believe, be seen as one of the most catastrophic collapses of life the Earth has ever seen. In just a few hundred years the Earth has gone from a beautiful, wild, and diverse place to a planet where more than 95% of mammals are cattle bred for food, pets bred for obedience, and humans pushed to compliance. The Earth is, of course, still beautiful and diverse, and has some wildness left. My argument is simply that so much has already collapsed and is already collapsing, **the collapse is not some future event**. The same goes for the economy, the climate, ecosystems, social welfare, spirituality, and life force in general. It is already happening, how do we control the descent, save what can be saved, and work on recovering and cultivating, fermenting, something better in and from the ruins?

**The collapse is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.**

**Outgoing connections:**
* [[Acceleration]] - Not knowing about the ongoing or coming crash makes accelerating the vehicle unproblematic.
* [[Avoiding radical options]] - If nothing radical seems to be happening it'll appear very odd to take radical measures.
* [[Bullshit jobs]] - We really don't have time for what most people spend their working hours on.
* [[Business-as-usual narrative]] - If you do not see or sense the negative effects of how things "have always been done" then there should be no issue continuing along the same tracks.
* [[Carelessness]]
* [[Catastrophic risks]] - Some catastrophes are already ongoing, slowly, but faster than we might think, and other catastrophes are still ahead of us, their probability of occurring increasing daily.
* [[Cognitive dissonance]] - If you do not yet hear the jarring dissonance, soon you will. 
* [[Delusional domination of nature]] - The delusional part is predominantly about our inability to see that in our domination we are actually the submissive part, forcing our own suicide through autoasphyxiation.
* [[Directionlessness]]
* [[Disinformation]] - Just because the spoken untruth has convinced even the speaker doesn't make it any less untrue.
* [[Educational crisis]] - Of all the subjects on the curriculum, what is preparing children for the unknown but very different world that we approach?
* [[Failure to take responsibility]] - How does one take responsibility for what one doesn't know? Well, if there is any willfulness in the ignorance, which I suspect is often the case, then the first step is to dare to look.
* [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - Impending doom is an important variable to consider in your optimisation algorithms.
* [[Greenwashing]] - Call me naive but I believe few people would greenwash their activities if they actually thought those activities were contributing to the end of civilisation. Or do I believe that? How malleable are the minds of butchers?
* [[Growth]] - The insecure male will do anything to keep compensating for the harsh truth.
* [[Illusion of competence]] - Eyes closed, holy fuck we're going fast.
* [[Ineffective institutions]] - What if the UN, when addressing their noble Sustainable Development Goals, were clear on the fact that we are currently not succeeding, not sustaining, not even mitigating the current collapse? Maybe they are clear on that, I actually don't care that much. 
* [[Lack of feeling needed]]
* [[Lack of humility]] - Facing failure head-on is a glorious opportunity for rebirth.
* [[Lack of purpose]] - All of you looking to do great things, here, take your shot.
* [[Lack of resilient systems]] - Would we have developed our systems differently if we were more aware of these matters?
* [[Misinformation]]
* [[Moloch]] - Being altogether igorant of ongoing collapses allows Moloch to fully drive your thoughts and desires.
* [[Naive progress narrative]] - Don't be so negative, I thought you wanted the summers to be hotter? Interest rates are down, stock market's up, unemployment is approaching an all-time low, and we can soon have vineyards and coffee plantations in the fjords of Norway, what's with the gloomy attitude?
* [[Naive techno-optimism]]
* [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]] - Would we willingly keep doing it if we knew our kids drank it?
* [[Propaganda]]
* [[Sense-making crisis]] - Viewing certain things from the perspective of continuous collapse leads to things making a whole lot more sense.
* [[Simplifications]]
* [[Slow change]] - If only we knew.
* [[Solutionism]] - Collapse? No, no, simply some bumps along the road, we'll fix it, don't you fret.
* [[Sustainable growth]] - Sustainable growth failed from the start.
* [[Tipping points]] - Like being deep underwater, we might not even notice the tipping points because we barely know what direction's up or down anyway.
* [[Unbalanced longtermism]] - Unrealistic longtermism? Like an abusive couple planning their honey moon.
* [[Unheeded warnings]] - So many warnings.
* [[Waste]] - We cannot afford to waste anything.
* [[Wisdom crisis]]
