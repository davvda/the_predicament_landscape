Calm down, hear me out. Modern healthcare is, in many ways, rightfully placed at the top of modern human achievement. There are about a billion asterisks to this statement, mainly consisting of arguments about the failure of accepting illness, suffering, pain, and death as well as [iatrogenic diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis) etc... But nonetheless, modern healthcare might be a reason why I can write this and why you can read it. So what's the problem, or rather, what's the predicament in modern healthcare? Once again, it is an issue with balance, optimisation, and the exclusion of non-quantifiable aspects of health. Let's look at an example.

Healthcare in Sweden is **absolutely atrocious and also completely incredible**. On the one side, for most health issues you will be met with different medical doctors each appointment, most of them only having a few stressful minutes to half-listen before sending you on your way without too much hassle and effort. Meeting human to human, trusting expertise, being listened to, finding help for mental health issues, being taken seriously, all of this is a rarity in healthcare. However, prove that your condition is serious enough and nurses, doctors, surgeons, therapists, priests, and, I'm sure, the prime minister, suddenly spawn out of nowhere and you're sent through a mechanistic wonder of expertise, reason, intuition, skill, efficiency, medical substances, all in order for you to come out the other side healthy and alive, barely paying a dime for it. There is something to this. Is it modernity excelling at treating sickness while being almost incapacitated with regards to health and a good life? Also, what roles do medications, something medical corporations profit from, play in the maintaining but not curing of a population? There is something to this. We have somehow gotten healthcare very wrong while getting parts of it very right. Why? Also, the way we tackle curing cancers never seems to include a conversation about halting the release of anthropogenic carcinogens? Why? Can we get healthcare right if we get everything else wrong?

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Addiction]] - Healthcare driven by companies selling medications makes our doctors into drug dealers.
- [[Carelessness]] - In order to make healthcare as efficient as possible we've largely removed the care.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Many common and not-so-common issues of being a living human will not fit neatly into a healthcare system designed after the same principles that dictate industrial processes. Health problems that can be remedied through a reductionistic approach have seen incredible progress in the course of modernity but problems that require a holistic approach have been met largely by confusion, incompetence, and worsening interventions.
- [[Cost of living]]
- [[Dealing with death]] - Modern healthcare avoids death at all cost but knows little of living.
- [[Elderly care]]
- [[Genetic modification]]
- [[Ignoring complexity]]
- [[Illusion of no option]] - How many people are medicated simply to survive the options of living they believe to be obligatory, the only options?
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - Talking about mental health as an issue of neurochemical imbalance creates an illusion of understanding mental health. It differs little from what Westerners often sneer at such as the chakras or other "alternative medicines".
- [[Inequality]]
- [[Lack of agency]] - Modern healthcare places the locus of control externally.
- [[Lack of balance]] - Oh, how glorious the meeting point of Western reductionist medicine with Eastern holistic practices would be... Shame they often refuse to speak each others' languages.
* [[Malnutrition]] - Did you know medical doctors in Sweden have one single lecture about nutrition during their 5+ years of education? Just a fun fact. Historically, how much of healthcare has been about what we eat and drink? Probably quite a bit. 
* [[Mental health]]
* [[Monopolies]]
* [[Naive progress narrative]] - How should we think about the fact that we're getting better at curing cancers while simultaneously getting better at creating them?
* [[Obesity]] - Obesity stands out as a bulging example of how our approach to health has largely failed.
* [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - Antidepressants exist in order for you to unquestioningly accept your required societal roles.
* [[Over-reliance on technology]]
* [[Profit]] - Healthcare is not immune to the profit incentives of our economies.
* [[Simplifications]]
* [[Solutionism]] - It is highly inefficient to spend the time digging for root causes.
