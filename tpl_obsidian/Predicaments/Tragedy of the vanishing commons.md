With the restless expansion of the global market and its inclusion of everything we end up with a society lacking in one, public spaces that are free to spend time in and two, plots of land one is free to use for growing things. This presents us with the tragedy of the vanishing commons. Without free public spaces one gets increasingly cut off from one's social place in society and **without a connection to the land one's natural place and belonging is lost**. Why care about a society you have no part in and why care about a natural world you don't belong to? Stop the vanishing of the commons and we might realise what we've got to lose.
