Lack of balance might be one of the predicaments in the landscape that can be found in almost all other predicaments. We are out of balance in so many ways. Balance means equality of two or more masses. Figuratively, balance can also mean **equality of any opposing or compared forces, objects, or processes**. The more we develop, the more complex and volatile our scales become and we seem to have reached a point where the most probable path to equilibrium is an involuntary emptying of the scales. How can we find balance?
