Quite an obvious one, is it not? Although, I would claim that as a predicament this one points to two separate mistreatments of other humans. One is **the deliberate and intentional mistreatment of humans**, unrelated to what motivates said mistreatment. Killing, raping, enslaving, abusing, isolating, marginalising, excluding, etc. The other, more fickle, all-encompassing, and hidden is **the global systemic mistreatment of other humans somehow unfit for the life of modernity**. There exist no righteous, reasonable, or even acceptable motivations for the mistreatment of those who stand in the way of the stampede of modernity and, sadly, the more crippled, blind, and injured modernity becomes the less it cares about what it tramples as it moves ahead.

The main issue with this predicament is that most of us don't recognise or acknowledge our complicity in the mistreatment of other humans. Why should we? Aren't we enlightened and good people? Well, no, it might be true for christmas presents but for most actions it is not the thought that counts.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Biased evidence selection]]** - To keep the narrative of modernity alive as more and more people are mistreated the collection of evidence must be increasingly selective, increasingly skewed, increasingly excluding.
*   **[[Blaming the people]]** - In situations of systemic mistreatment of others it is always easiest to blame the people. Either the people you mistreat, the people desiring their mistreatment, or both.
*   **[[Cognitive dissonance]]** - If everything is going so well, how come so many seem to be unwell?
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - The spreading of modernity across the Earth is better for everyone, I swear, it is, right?
*   **[[Democracy failing]]** - If the people really are ruling, for how long can they be mistreated before it all falls apart?
*   **[[Despair]]** - Internalise a fraction of the necessary mistreatment required for any Westerner to participate in society and it's difficult to avoid despair.
*   **[[Dispositionism]]** - They simply have to be treated this way, it's just the way they are.
*   **[[Emotional crisis]]** - Can you hear them? No? Maybe their screams are hidden under the rubble?
*   **[[Failure to take responsibility]]** - Who takes responsibility for such apparently benevolent systemic mistreatment? How?
*   **[[Hobbesian views]]** - Similarly to how colonialist narratives are utilised to justify our mistreatment of other humans we can double down on our Hobbesian views of humans as justification for our mistreatment.
*   **[[Ignorance of interconnectedness]]** - Many people reading this might feel unaffected by the mistreatment of others. After all, why would the suffering of people on the other side of the world affect you?
*   **[[Ignored externalities]]** - La la la, I'm not listening.
*   **[[Illusion of no option]]** - Well, to make an omelette you have to break some skulls, don't you see?
*   **[[Immoral justifications]]** - The dominating narratives require constant justifications.
*   **[[Migration]]** - People often migrate to get away from certain mistreatment.
*   **[[Mistreatment of animals]]** - Since we value humans more than animals the acceptance of the severity of mistreatment of animals and humans will go hand in hand. The worse mistreatment of humans we accept, the worse mistreatment of animals we accept.
*   **[[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]]** - How is it mistreatment if, deep down, they know it's good for them?
*   **[[Polarisation]]** - The selective mistreatment of humans seems to be a generator of polarisation.
*   **[[Sense-making crisis]]** - How does one even begin to make sense of the mess of systemic mistreatment we're living in?
*   **[[Social erosion]]** - It appears that whenever social erosion occurs in a two-sided argument it is because one side is less hesitant towards the mistreatment of a certain group of people.
*   **[[The Dark Triad]]** - Whoever can mistreat people and remain unaffected will have an easier time continuing to do so.
*   **[[Views on human nature]]** - Constantly tweaking our views on human nature becomes a necessity for the continued mistreatment of others and its justifications.
*   **[[Violence]]** - Mistreatment breeds mistreatment. Violence breeds violence.
*   **[[War]]** - Either, those mistreated pick up weapons, or, the oppressors strike first.
