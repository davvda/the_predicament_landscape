Wisdom, spirituality, animism, and elders have contributed historically to creating **cultural control systems which, as opposed to laws, control behaviours with an open hand.** Modernity mostly lacks cultural control systems since they have been replaced by game theory. When people mention the need for religion, "a new christianity", or a complete destruction of capitalism, I believe the foundational discussion that must be had is one of cultural control systems in general. A faulty control system will lead to complete lack of cultural balance, an absence of any control system whatsoever is unbounded chaos.
