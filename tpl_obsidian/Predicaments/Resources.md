(CHANGE TO DWINDLING RESOURCES?)

As living beings there is no getting around the fact that we need resources for our continued survival. In many ways, the acquiring of resources and the management of waste is what defines a well-adapted living organism. Unfortunately, **we're currently extracting and using resources in ways that don't give them time to [rise again](https://www.etymonline.com/word/resource), leading to resource depletion**.

There are several types of resources and these include, just to name a few, fossil fuels, minerals, metals, animals, water, humans, computing resources, air, and plants. Finding and employing the suitable methods of extraction and utilisation of these resources in sustainable amounts is crucial for our survival.
