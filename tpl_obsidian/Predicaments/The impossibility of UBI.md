One of the things that trap humans from doing what their families, local communities, society, and planet need is the obligation to, in order to earn a living, do what corporations and organisations need. Universal basic income could tackle this problem head-on by **giving everybody a basic income with no strings attached**. However, with the main incentive for nations being economic growth, UBI constantly gets blocked from becoming reality. UBI also requires governments and corporations to trust people to do the right thing, or anything, and since those who tend to rise to the top are ignorant of what the right thing, or anything, is there will always be colliding incentives here, with beliefs that anyone not forced to work will simply become a criminal or, god forbid, a lazy person.
