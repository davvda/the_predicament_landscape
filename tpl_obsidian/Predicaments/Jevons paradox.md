**[In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) This was originally related to the efficiency and increase in coal use. As technology improves energy efficiency we end up using more rather than less of the resource required for the activity. There is, in other words, always an important nuance to any discussion related to technological advances that promise increased efficiency in that they potentially worsen the problem they claim to solve.
