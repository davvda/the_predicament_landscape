Justification is the act of showing something to be right or proper. Morals are principles concerning right and proper behaviour of humans in society. The paradox of modernity with its notions of progress largely stems from our uncanny ability to justify our improper actions, both to others but maybe more so to ourselves. **Our justifications of moral are quite immoral**. We need this immoral veneer of justifications to separate and protect us from the higher order effects of our needs and consequent actions, in order to believe that we are good people when, in reality, we might, mostly unwillingly and unknowingly, be eons away from the civilised saintliness we imagine.

- [[Educational crisis]] - Don't do drugs, stay in school. Actually, don't do drugs or school. Fuck drugs and fuck school. Poor kids. 
- [[Elderly care]] - As a general rule, question anything modernity has ever come up with that includes the word "care". Experiment replacing the word with more modernity-leaning words like "management" or "waste facility".
- [[Energy consumption increasing]] - Sweden's prime minister has stated that the best way to inspire developing countries is by showing them how great it is to be wealthy. I'm sure there's a point somewhere in there but I missed it. He's got pretty good calves though.
- [[Evil]] - Ding ding ding! Take immoral justifications far enough and you've arrived at evil. Hope you've got a unique moustache to match the others, or maybe like a shaved eyebrow or something?
- [[Genocide]]
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - Turning a blind eye for self-preservation's sake is now longer morally justifiable. Die now.

- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Even with all morals aside, are things going that well? Last I checked we had PFAS in every rain drop on the planet. Chemical colonialism?
- [[No precautionary principle]]
- [[Obesity]] - Is obesity partly a question of morals? If so, whose moral standpoint is being questioned?
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]]
- [[Poverty]] - Remind me why povert exists.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Power concentration to those who don't even see the need to justify anything. Morals? What, those big paintings on the sides of buildings?

- [[Waste]] - Is it crazy to think that any waste not put to use or at the very least handled properly is highly immoral? It's tough being a "Should I"-man in world full of Yes-men.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Morals are rules and principles that attempt to mimic the path of wisdom. They're essential but not enough. We haven't even reached the beginning.
