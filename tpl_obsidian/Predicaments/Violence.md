What is violence? What you think of is probably physical violence - causing bodily harm to someone. **Violence is any path that uses undue force**. Now, does any wise path actually require any force at all? There is violence in thought, words, and actions. To end violence, therefore, we must first find peace in our thoughts and perceptions.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Acceleration]]** - We humans often use violence to force ourselves forward, to accelerate along a path covered with obstacles.
*   **[[Apathy]]** - Violence requires and generates apathy towards the victim. Who is the victim?
*   **[[Avoiding uncertainty]]** - Certainty through violence. The slogan of modern man?
*   **[[Carelessness]]** - Violence is perhaps the exact opposite of care.
*   **[[Cognitive dissonance]]** - Violence and cognitive dissonance have many connections. The two most clear ones are that cognitive dissonance often becomes a requirement for the wielder of violence when the victim's ability to fight back is low. The cognitive dissonance required to believe one to be a good person while throwing a baby out of a window and raping and killing the mother, as an example. The other is the cognitive dissonance required by both the perpetrator and the civilians on the perpetrator's side that justifies that violence. Just think for a moment... The other day I heard someone at my local gym scoff at the fact that there were protestors outside their university because a Swedish weapons manufacturer was there at a recruiting event. Now, this person is a fully reasonable person, relatively, and was fully entrenched in the opinion of the stupidity of these protestors. Meanwhile, clueless engineers mingle with students to find those most violently intelligent to work on efficient technology for killing humans. Apologies for this anecdote, maybe it sounds forced and far-fetched? I'm having difficulties with feelings of misanthropy at the moment. Every person who works with a certain weapon should have to live through its effects. You work designing missiles? Your family will have to sit inside a building while we practice firing at it. Fighter jets? We'll fly by your house shooting at it in the middle of the night. Ah, you work with surveillance? We'll track every step you and your children take and if a child speaks wrongly, we'll make them disappear. Don't worry, you'll get them back after the next sprint. It's on the kanban board.
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - We stand on fundaments of violence and must never stop justifying why things are the way they are.
*   **[[Deforestation]]** - Clear-cut forest graveyards, stumps headstones for each violent death.
*   **[[Evil]]** - Violence feeds into evil.
*   **[[Failure to take responsibility]]** - How can we be held responsible for our current and previous violence? Can we?

*   **[[Finite games]]** - Finite games are often games of violence.
*   **[[Genocide]]** - Violence is sometimes the beginning of a solution whose end is genocide.
*   **[[Government]]** - Also known as legal violence monopoly.
*   **[[Hobbesian views]]** - Hobbes was right, turns of humans are nothing but violent beasts. Only thing is, he was wrong about civilisation somehow controlling the violence, instead it has only made it worse, subtler, more powerful, pervasive.
*   **[[Illusion of no option]]** - We begin with violence and then pretend it was our last resort.
*   **[[Immoral justifications]]** - How would you justify violence? Perhaps you saw a violent act necessary to avoid an even more violent act? Think about it. When have you justified your own violence? What is necessary for an act of violence to, for you, appear unjustifiable? What violent act requires no justification at all? What do you think when you drive past roadkill?
*   **[[Imprisonment]]** - An individual who uses violence in ways not conducive with the governing entity's agenda will most likely have their degree of freedom adjusted.
*   **[[Industrial slaughter]]** - Industrialised violence.
*   **[[Lack of faith in anything]]** - I often stop and think... If certain crises end up snowballing into a world exclusively consisting of war and violence, what was the point of all this work anyway? What was the point of anything? It takes so much for a person to believe in and try to create positive change, it takes so little for their skull to crack.
*   **[[Lack of feeling needed]]** - As the nations of the world increasingly threaten others with violence it makes me wonder if I should stop all activities I feel called to and simply make my family proud by joining the army. Actually, that's not true, I don't feel that.
*   **[[Lack of love]]** - There is no love in violence.
*   **[[Laws]]** - We currently try to bind most acts of violence with laws.

*   **[[Mistreatment of animals]]** - We are violent against other beings. All of the time.
*   **[[Mistreatment of other humans]]** - We are violent against other humans. Most of the time.
*   **[[Moloch]]** - Moloch just slipped me a note that he wants me to show whoever is reading this. It's just a drawing of a dick. It's actually quite nicely drawn, if I'm honest.
*   **[[Monocultures (agriculture)]]** - Forcefully shaping the earth to homogeneity.
*   **[[Monocultures (people)]]** - Forcefully shaping humankind to homogeneity.
*   **[[Naive progress narrative]]** - Unemployment rate is at an all time low after we executed all of the unemployed. Excellent. The only way is up!
*   **[[National borders]]** - Twofold violence connection here. One is that national borders often result from acts of violence. The other is that drawing and then enforcing borders for someone else's land from a thousand miles away is a type of violence unheard of for much of human history.
*   **[[News]]** - News broadcasts broadly cast three categories: sport, weather, and violence. Were you born in the wrong time?

*   **[[Surveillance]]** - Everything must be kept in view to make sure violence isn't being used by the wrong people.
*   **[[The desacration of all places]]** - Is there any place left on earth spared from violence?
*   **[[Views on human nature]]** - Every act of violence enforces the view of humans as inherently violent.
*   **[[War]]** - War is a game of violence and its related technologies and capacities.
*   **[[Wisdom crisis]]** - If there occurs a convergence of events to a point in the landscape that ends the current world of humans and creates a new one, it is not impossible that the species stepping into that world is Homo Violens
