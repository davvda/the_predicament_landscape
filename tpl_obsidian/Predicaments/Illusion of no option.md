**The illusion of no option means a false belief that there are no other ways but the current way of doing things**. So called capitalist realism is a type of illusion of no option which says that there are no functioning economic systems besides capitalism. We have no choice but to grow, extract, fight, use violence, use fossil fuels, be profitable, hire more scrum masters, enforce national borders, eat meat, use generative AI, earn money to pay rent, travel, invest, participate, and the list could go on forever. We live in a world structured by models and systems created by humans and these can, whether it appears that way or not, be changed.

- [[Business-as-usual narrative]]
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - The path we're obligated to take is a difficult path, so difficult in fact that many of us can't even see it as an option.

- [[Investing]] - I stumbled across a forum thread the other day. The person posting the thread was looking for advice on how to hedge for economic collapse to which most of the replies suggested investing more in gold or simply being patient through the turbulent times. Not a single person mentioned raising goats, getting to know your neighbours, or learning how to repair solar panels.
