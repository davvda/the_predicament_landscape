**We are moving so fast and changing what must change so slowly**. If at all. We seem stuck, like a toddler repeating the same joke not understanding why we're no longer laughing. There is so much we have to do, so much we should've already done, yet the incentives are misaligned, misdirected, all wrong. Do you see it? It isn't even that difficult, it would just require everyone, or most of us, maybe not even that, maybe just a few more, for a critical mass to be reached and for a phase shift to occur, like a chicken breaking out of its egg, realising the world is so much more than it thought, so much more than thought. The change is slow because we have such difficulty changing our [thoughts](https://ia601808.us.archive.org/16/items/david-bohm-thought-as-a-system/David%20Bohm%20-%20Thought%20as%20a%20System.pdf) and their manifestations.
