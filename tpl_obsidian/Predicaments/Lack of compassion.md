**Compassion means to suffer with someone and feel together**. A lack of compassion typically results in and from the closing of eyes and ears, halting the perception of the suffering of others, being blind and deaf to the afflictions one often has contributed in creating, willingly or not. Without compassion we end up with, well, much of the world as it is today. Killing with compassion is possible, industrial slaughter is not. Compassion is, more importantly, recognising and feeling someone else's feelings _and_ taking an active role in somehow helping the afflicted.
