> But in the clearing the grass is curiously green and alive. Big stones lie around as if placed that way. They must have been foundation stones for a house, maybe I’m wrong. Who lived there? No one can help with that. The name sleeps somewhere in the archive no one opens (only archives remain young). The oral tradition is dead, and with it the memories. The gypsy tribe remembers, but those who can write forget. Write it down and forget it.

> This little house hums with voices. It is the center of the world. But the people in it die or move away. The history ends. The place stands empty year after year. And the crofter’s house becomes a sphinx. At the end everything has gone away except the foundation stones.

> I’ve been here before somehow, but it’s time to leave. I dive in among the briary underbrush. To get through it you have to take one step forward and two steps to the side, like a chess piece. Slowly it thins out and the light increases. My steps grow longer. A path wiggles its way toward me. I am back in the communications net.

The magic complexity of the wild does not compute, it does not produce, it does not follow our measures of success and progress. The wild can not be tamed, so we kill it, or we at least try to. **In order for us to survive we must let the wild thrive**, give it hooks to grab and crevices to grow through, vines and ivy, wisteria crowning the headstone of our buried civilisation as we tend to the eternal.
