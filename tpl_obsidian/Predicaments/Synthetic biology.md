**Synthetic biology is a field of science whose main purpose is to understand and to be able to manipulate or create living systems and organisms**. It is closely related to, and includes, genetic modification but has a broader scope. Synthetic biology is the field responsible for biological weapons and, as with most technological predicaments, appears impossible to regulate and presents potentially catastrophic risks.
