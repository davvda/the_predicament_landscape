**The modern world lacks paths of initiation into woman- and manhood**. Putting any questions of binary gender and sex aside, there are clear difficulties in finding one's role in societies where positive feminine and masculine archetypes are missing.

Importantly, it is also important for men to understand the meaning of womanhood and vice versa. Woman- and manhood are complementary, [not opposing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang), forces. It is only in the joining of dualities that new wholeness, new life, is created.
