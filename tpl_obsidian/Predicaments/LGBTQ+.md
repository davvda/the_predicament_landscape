**LGBTQ+ is one of many acronyms used to group those who are not the sexual "norm"**. What is the predicament in LGBTQ+? First of all, there are undoubtedly several spectra within gender and sexuality no matter what one thinks or believes. If these spectra are biological, psychological, evolutionary, pathological, cultural, or social is for other texts to explore. Secondly, the polarisation of opinions with regards to LGBTQ+ rights as an extension of human rights has become a predicament, possibly through globalisation and the intermingling of cultures with differing views on the subject but other more indirect causes could also be to blame. Transrights have become even more complicated since they tend to come with expectations for medical and surgical treatments. I currently know too little of this predicament to expand it further.
