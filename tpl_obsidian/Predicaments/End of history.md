It is not unlikely that our lives will fill the last pages of the short book of the history of our human civilisation. What does it mean to be at the end of history? Well, at the very least it means that **we are at the dissolution of a certain narrative that has been constant throughout human civilisation**, the narrative of progress and ascent. We will either reach the pinnacle of this progress curve, something I believe we have already failed to do, or this narrative and its resulting manifestations will collapse, something I believe it has already started to do.

In the words of John Milbank "we are not so much subject to passing tensions, potentially resolvable, as to the ultimate emergence of tensions latent in the very foundations of the modern". The dynamics that got us to this point, that created our progress, are the same dynamics which create our downfall. Therefore, we must either redesign and rebuild our foundations or watch it all crumble. One of our most complicated problems is that we have built so many unsteady structures on top of this rotting foundation that it looks to be impossible to even approach the foundation without risking a complete collapse.

No matter what we do or where we go, we are at the end of history.
