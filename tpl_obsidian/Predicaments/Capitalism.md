> We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.

**[Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development occurs through the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)**. Capitalism, when it is combined with technological developments and increased energy availability, is probably the main concrete driver behind many of our problems, their current solutions and, importantly, one of the reasons for much of our increased material standard of living. As with most predicaments in the landscape it is crucial to identify not only what to reject, but how to balance the good with the bad for long-term thriving. There is plenty to criticise with the system of capitalism but this has to be done factoring in what it has done well in an attempt to bring that with us into whatever systems we choose as the alternative. For capitalism to continue in its current form there must be (more or less) infinite growth and with us approaching several planetary boundaries, and having passed many of them, continued growth is not a viable option, meaning capitalism most likely isn't one either.

> ...all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the moneychangers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]]
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Capitalism can not change, will not change, it either has to be dismantled or destroyed.
- [[Big tech]] - Capitalism has created the tech giants of today.
- [[Blaming the people]] - Capitalism puts all blame on those who demand, not those whose supply manipulates demand.
- [[Bullshit jobs]]
- [[Business-as-usual narrative]]
- [[Centralisation]] - An etymological root to capitalism is caput - head. Centralise all financial flows towards a few heads of commerce and states.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Capitalism is a simple model left to act for too long in a complex world.
- [[Consumerism]] - Capitalism provides for consumers because it requires their continuous and ever-growing consumption.
- [[Debt]] - On the surface, capitalism generates wealth out of nothing. It will firmly remind you of your monetary debt but deftly hides its own debts to all life. Capitalism, slightly simplified, works through putting the future in debt motivated by the assumption that the future will have even more capital and even more debt. It is, through this lens, a clear example of the foundations of largely empty not-accounted-for promises our civilisation rests upon.
- [[Directionlessness]] - Capitalism's direction is towards *more*.
- [[Distractions]] - Capitalism and its implicit requirements covers the entire planet and is the one distraction that is obligatory for us all. Or so it seems.
- [[End of history]]
- [[Energy]]
- [[Energy consumption increasing]]
- [[Evil]] - It is fascinating how many deeply evil acts can be made to appear benevolent simply by capitalistic motivations.
- [[Finite games]] - Capitalism is one finite game cloaked in an illusion of the infinite. What do you think, do all humans have this hubristic tendency? Is it a simple case of *power corrupts* or are we truly, well and truly, royally fucked?
- [[Global supply chains]] - The engorged head of capitalism has eaten the world and we're living through it's acid reflux.
- [[Government]] - No government is independent of capitalism and the business world.
- [[Greed]] - In a capitalist system, greed is a virtue.
- [[Growth]] - Capitalism requires endless growth, as well as a constant increase in the rate of growth. I'm just an uneducated punk, but I must wonder if economists have looked at this and seen an obvious flaw in the plan. They're probably too busy playing golf. Golf is not a sport, by the way.
- [[Hedonism]] - Hedonism is the ultimate reward for having skillfully participated in capitalism.
- [[Ignored externalities]] - For capitalism to work, it must externalise most costs that would be detrimental to its continued existence. However, don't fret, the larger system of which capitalism is a tiny subsystem has its own debt collectors and bounty hunters. You might wonder if that's the sound you're hearing, the knocks on the door, but no, they broke down the door long ago, they're playing scrabble in the foyer, discussing the probability of us killing ourselves before they ask us to pay up.
- [[Illusion of no option]]
- [[Immoral justifications]] - Capitalism makes it ludicrously easy to justify immoral acts.
- [[Individualism]] - In capitalism, the only way to win is for someone else to lose. Make sure you, only you, win, and if you ever step on the victor's podium, never let them drag you down.
- [[Investing]]
- [[Lack of agency]] - "Dismantle capitalism". Yes, sure, but how does one kill a hydra with over eight billion heads?
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - Capitalism is not and has never been a viable longterm plan.
- [[Meaning crisis]] - Modern life is comfortable and you are free to buy whatever kind of life you want.
- [[Monopolies]] - Capitalism has logical endpoints in monopolies controlling parts of the system. There is no such thing as a free market. There never has been. Be born and raised in capitalism and it will have power over what you can imagine that you want.
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Please write a one-page essay on what you believe all indigenous tribes murdered by messengers of capitalism think of the beautiful world capitalism has created. There is absolutely nothing you can say to me about the progress of modernity and our resource abundance in a world where a fucking oak is more exotic than a scyscraper. Liminal spaces behind crowded malls, khaki cement and parking lot asphalt, fat Subway worker in tights smoking her cigarette, checking her phone, in a broken lawn chair. Heaven is glorious. Sweet relief of death, flood us all.
- [[Poverty]] - Any place being introduced to capitalism is simultaneously introduced to poverty. It isn't dissimilar to a place visited by missionaries, an entire tribe suddenly become devilish sinners.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Newsflash. Capitalism does not reward people for having others' best in mind.
- [[Profit]]
- [[Resources]]
- [[Selfishness]]
- [[Status]] - How high up are you on this human-centipede-ladder?
- [[The impossibility of UBI]] - If capitalism requires more and UBI creates less... Well, that's just not gonna fly, is it?
- [[The spectacle]] - 34. The spectacle is capital accumulated to the point that it becomes images.
- [[Unpaid important labour]]
- [[Weber's iron cage]]
