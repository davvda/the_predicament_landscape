Information can **give form to** thought and be part of the process of acquiring knowledge but it is, undeniably, not knowledge. The relationship between information and knowledge can be likened to the one between vision and seeing. Not all who have vision truly see. Another metaphor is that of information as bricks and knowledge as a built structure. Treating information as if it was equal to knowledge can result in an overreliance on data, bad decision-making, lack of adaptive behaviour, overconfidence, illusion of understanding, lack of a broader perception, bad predictions, false beliefs, and more. Information is also external whereas knowledge is something deeply internal and this, importantly, is what makes information so easily transferable compared to knowledge. Information is neutral whereas knowledge can come with judgement, suitable action, awareness, purpose, and understanding. Beware of the need to "stay informed" as it can often mean rejecting the time and space needed for the forming of knowledge.
