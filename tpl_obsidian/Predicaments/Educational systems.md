**Many educational systems are more about indoctrination and training than cultivating understanding**. Education should create dependable, predictable, and productive humans for the global systems of commerce and civilisational expansion. In a world where, for our continued survival, we must question everything we thought we knew, the educational system will always be several steps behind, discouraging any curiosity to leave the boundaries of the curriculum. The mental tools that can make sure that the world of your grandchildren isn't destroyed or dystopian is nowhere in the curriculum, sorry 'bout that.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Advertising]] - As Ivan says above, school is advertising for modernity. Often compulsory advertising.
- [[Avoiding radical options]]
- [[Avoiding uncertainty]] - One of the main purposes of our educational systems is to remove all uncertainty from what a child becomes as an adult citizen.
* [[Being reasonable]] - Education is the near-industrial production of unreasonably dumb reasonable adults.
- [[Blaming the people]] - Perform badly in school, respond badly to modern education, it's on you.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - The one benevolence with schooling is that it attempts to, through bullshit work, make us ready for a lifetime of bullshit work.
- [[Complexity mismatch]]
- [[Discrimination]]
- [[Disinformation]]
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - The educational systems fail to take responsibility for what it creates or fails to create, and what it creates is more people unable to take responsibility for their own existence.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - Atrophying the right hemisphere, doping the left.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]]
- [[Ignored externalities]] - The ignored externalities of education... Well, the failings of educating humans and making children into responsible adults who then continue the process of maturing is apparent in everything around us.
- [[Illusion of competence]] - When I, after much toil, got my engineering degree I realised that I finally knew nothing about anything and I'd be paid well for it.
- [[Imprisonment]] - Is it taking it too far to claim that school is a temporary prison for children?
- [[Inequality]]
- [[Lack of agency]]
- [[Lack of balance]]
- [[Lack of systems thinking]]
- [[Lack of time]] - Children learn best through play. Play requires time and space, unbounded.
- [[Predicaments/Language]]
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]]
- [[Madness of safety]] - Children must be kept safe and enclosed within systems of certainty of stability.
- [[Mind-body separation]]
- [[Misinformation]]
- [[Missing elders]] - What type of person decides to become a teacher? Often a well-meaning person, I'm sure. In Buddhism you sometimes say that none should ever teach unless asked to teach. Will those whose teachings are most valuable become school teachers? Maybe you sneer, thinking that the routine kneading of children's minds, the decade or more of formal schooling that serves as the singular passage through childhood and adolescence, the shaping of the world-view of all citizens, it's nothing but a job, and everyone needs a job. 
- [[Mistreatment of other humans]] - Benevolent torture.
- [[Monocultures (people)]]
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - Close to a definition of educational systems.
- [[Predicaments/Parenting|Parenting]] - I'd argue that school and work are the main hindrances to good parenting.
- [[Propaganda]] - The modern educational system is the propagation of the western agenda through the voice of every child passing through its bowels.
- [[Quantification]]
- [[Rationalism]] - Unsure about this. I don't remember my schooling touching on the subject of being rational but still, there is a weak connection here somewhere.
- [[Reductionism]]
- [[Sameness]] - Sameness in the output of the system is the entire purpose of the system.
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]]
- [[Sense-making crisis]]
- [[Simplifications]]
- [[Slow change]] - If everyone wanting to change themselves or the world first need a lifetime of unlearning it isn't strange that we always realise our faults so late.
- [[Status]] - Education gives status.
- [[Story of separation]]
- [[Surveillance]] - Keep all kids in the same place and keep watch for any deviating behaviour.
- [[The death of creative work]] - Stop it, stay within the expected boundaries, do what's expected of you, no more no less.
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - Tame all that's left of that inner wild child.
- [[Waste]] - Waste of fucking time.
- [[Weber's iron cage]] - From one cage to another.
- [[Yuppie dystopia]] - Stupid people with framed degrees and immense power.
