There are, according to James Carse, two kinds of games. **Finite games are played for the purpose of winning** and infinite games for the purpose of continuing the play. An infinite game can contain one or more finite games, a finite game cannot contain an infinite game. Modernity has chosen to exclusively focus on finite games. Finite games keeps us wrongly competitive, static, hostile, individualist, tribal, polarised, suspicious, miserable, and blindly heading for destruction. Infinite games lead us to be cooperative, dynamic, open, inclusive, ever-changing, engaged, and adaptive to whatever may come our way.

Life is an infinite game filled with finite games. James Carse again: "Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do". How much in your life feels like a decision taken for you, something you must do?

> Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - A finite player would never question, oppose, or stray near the boundaries of the game.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - How things are going for a finite player will be judged within and exclusively from the results of the finite game being played. The world outside of the arena might as well be on fire as long as we're in the lead.
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Sadly, modern humans have decided to view evolution as a finite game with the victor being the one dominating species above all others.
- [[Catastrophic risks]] - We're playing golf with nuclear warheads. 
- [[Centralisation]] - Victors of the finite games of modern society tend to gain power and climb upwards to central points of decision-making. It is not surprising that the so-called development of our societies map onto the same finite-game structures that the decision-makers fought within to get their power.
- [[Climate change]]
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - Life becomes terribly difficult to live if you are unable to see the grander infinite games. However, within modernity it somtimes becomes more difficult when you clearly see the necessary finite games on lower levels seeming to oppose the grander games. I find the dissonance to be jarring most days.
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Finite players conquering lands of infinite players.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Finite games are too rigid to fit the infinity of a well-lived life and a properly handled civilisation. Remember, an infinite game can fit an infinite amount of finite games within it whereas a finite game doesn't fit that much more than itself.
- [[Culture wars]] - One culture to rule them all and in complacency bind them.
- [[Dealing with death]] - Death is not defeat.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]]
- [[Directionlessness]]
- [[Distractions]] - There is nothing wrong with partaking in finite games but it is vital that they be consciously contained within some grander infinite game. Today, most people are so caught up in finite games they either laugh or cry when getting a glimpse of the infinite game around them, perhaps in the glint of their children's eyes.
- [[Ecological crisis]]
- [[Educational crisis]]
- [[Ego]] - Finite games are played by and for the ego. Most times.
- [[End of history]] - Our finite games are creating their own prophecy, that of all human history being a finite game, having an end. However, the only winners will be those who decided to leave the field and play something else, those partaking in a different history, another story.
- [[Energy]]
- [[Evil]] - Much evil can be explained as clever tactics within the rules of the game.
- [[Exponential technology]] - Whatever technology makes the player more powerful.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - The very best players do not consider anything outside of the boundaries of their game. A second of doubt leaves room for other players to advance.
- [[Genocide]] - The finite game of being the one victorious people.
- [[Greed]]
- [[Growth]] - We're playing a finite game of infinite growth.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]]
- [[Ignorance of the mystical]] - The infinite game surrounding all is not graspable.
- [[Ignored externalities]]
- [[Ignoring complexity]]
- [[Illusion of no option]] - Few players find out about the larger games.
- [[Ineffective institutions]] - The unintended effects of sticking to the rigid rules of a finite game in the shifting landscape of an infinite one can be seen all around us.
- [[Inertia]] - We keep playing games we didn't invent for purposes we've forgotten.
- [[Lack of agency]]
- [[Lack of attentiveness]] - It is necessary to step out of the finite games for a time to be able to pay attention to different scales of both time and space.
- [[Lack of balance]] - There is nothing inherently wrong with games being finite as long as they do not threaten the balance of the conditions required for any games to be played at all.
- [[Lack of purpose]]
- [[Lack of the longterm]]
- [[Material extraction]]
- [[Maximum power principle]] - The infinite game of power made finite.
- [[Meaning crisis]]
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - The consecutive winner of finite games sees itself and the world becoming ever better and better.
- [[Nuclear war]] - A very finite game.
- [[Planetary boundaries]] - There is an interesting dynamic going on here. To be able to play the infinite game well, one must learn how to manage everything that is finite and play within the boundaries that allow the game to be kept alive.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Congratulations, we won. Please, have some champagne and spare some for the other corpses.
- [[Profit]]
- [[Quantification]] - Humanity 1 - Nature 0
- [[Resource conflicts]]
- [[Resources]]
- [[Selfishness]]
- [[Sex and sexuality]] - Even sex is now often played as a finite game.
- [[Solutionism]] - Win over the problem. Have it be removed completely. Out of sight, out of mind.
- [[Spiritual metacrisis]] - One way of framing the spiritual crisis of modernity is the loss of the infinite surrounding all life. Call it religion, God, punk, it matters not.
- [[Status]] - The majority of finite games are played for either power, status, or most frequently both.
- [[Sustainable growth]] - What if we pretend that our finite game is infinite? Would that work? Y'know, power of the mind and all?
- [[The desacration of all places]] - For every goal scored a forest is burnt and a puppy killed.
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - For the purpose of the finite game of the maximisation of all things unwild.
- [[Tipping points]] - Finite games will be stopped by outer forces.
- [[Unbalanced longtermism]] - Dinner is getting cold, sun has set, kids, time to stop playing.
- [[Violence]]
- [[War]] - The ultimate finite game.
- [[Weber's iron cage]] - Stuck in the finite games of modernity.
- [[Wisdom crisis]]
