**The view of the world as dead, inanimate, and mechanistic is not particularly congruent with the synergistic, self-regulating, and complex nature of the world as it presents itself to our lived experience**. However, this view makes it easier to justify manipulating its parts. Strapping the plow on the oxen both makes it into, and requires the oxen to be seen as, nothing but a machine. Further, if we see the world as inanimate then our actions cannot kill it because it never lived in the first place. The world is not a collection of _dead static things_, it is an endless ocean of _living flowing streams_.
