**Genetic modification means modifying the underlying genetic blueprint for any organism** using technology, usually with the intent of adding desirable traits and/or removing undesirable ones, but also creating novel organisms. It is potentially the final stepping stone in our manipulation-focused mechanistic view of life.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]] - Genetic modification is one path to accelerating evolution as well as potentially accelerating us towards catastrophe.
- [[Access to food]] - It might increase crop yields but the total effect of genetic modification on our access to food and proper nutrition is as of yet inconclusive.
- [[Access to water]] - Several genetically modified crops require increased pesticide use, much of which ends up polluting water sources.
- [[Agriculture]]
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Genetically modified animals and plants are rarely beneficial for their under-developed cousins.
- [[Catastrophic risks]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Genetically modified crops can often mean an increase in yield and a narrowing of ideal conditions.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - Even I'll concede that our advancements in genetics is the least delusional domination of nature we've come up with. Though, we should be clear that what we see in the mirror is a demon, not a god.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - The natural systems of Earth are being destabilised by genetically modified organisms.
- [[Energy]]
- [[Exponential technology]]
- [[Ignorance of the mythical]] - If you picture the person, scientist, wizard, whatever, that is meddling with the "blueprint of life" in any mythical story, is this person portrayed as a villain or a hero?
- [[Ignored externalities]]
- [[Ignoring complexity]] - What natural power of adaptability comes with the complexity of life?
- [[Ignoring diversity]] - What natural power of adaptability comes with the diversity of life?
- [[Illusion of competence]] - I, for one, do not in the slightest trust our abilities to ensure that genetic modifications can be done safely. I also don't trust in our initial benevolence ensuring that we even try to do it safely. In general, if it isn't already clear from the entire landscape, I would not trust humanity with more power than can be achieved through hand tools unless we first find the wisdom to usefully wield such power.
- [[Insect loss]]
- [[Lack of a living world view]] - Complex machines that are easily altered.
- [[Mistreatment of animals]]
- [[Monocultures (agriculture)]] - The overall issue of GMO crops, monocultures, and land-use is more complicated and multi-faceted than might be expected. GMO does seem to increase the amount of monocultures but the larger effects of this change is as of yet difficult to conclude.
- [[Monopolies]] - Many farmers must buy their seeds from singular actors.
- [[Naive techno-optimism]] - We shouldn't blindly accept any of the premises behind genetic modification.
- [[Naive techno-pessimism]] - ...nor should we completely deny them. Genetic modification with more or less artificial means have always been part of our agricultural practices and will continue to play an important role in the future. This technology has arrived and is here to stay, no matter its shape, and we'd do well to learn how to wield it wisely.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - ...but we shouldn't completely rely on a practice so potentially fragile and disruptive.
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]]
- [[Pollution]] - Genetically modified crops tend to have the downside of increased pesticide use.
- [[Population growth]]
- [[Profit]]
- [[Quantification]] - Yields, yields, yields!
- [[Soil erosion]] - The total effect on soil erosion is hard to know but there definitely is one, one way or the other.
- [[Synthetic biology]] - If we can modify organisms, we should be able to create them from scratch, right? Yes, but please don't.
- [[The desacration of all places]] - Nothing is sacred.
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - Nothing can remain wild.
- [[Tipping points]] - What tipping points are we moving towards with genetic modifications?
