**Dispositionism is a term in social psychology used to describe those that believe people's actions are conditioned by internal factors rather than the situation they find themselves in**. Dispositionism tends to go hand in hand with a static and often despairing view of people and the way that is "just how they are". It is an excellent method of avoiding difficult problems and situations such as poverty, crime, addiction, and war among others. A dispositionist view of others leaves one vulnerable to [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) where situational and environmental factors are underemphasised. The opposite to dispositionism is situationism, also known as please-think-about-this-deeply-for-one-second-longer-you-are-absolutely-ridiculous-in-the-way-you-judge-others-and-not-yourself.
