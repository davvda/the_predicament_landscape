**The Dark Triad of human psychology consists of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy**. Briefly explained, narcissism is the focus on oneself, Machiavellianism is the ability to play others as pieces on a chess board, and psychopathy can mean impaired empathy and remorse, often combined with charm. Exhibit all traits of the dark triad and you'll most likely be well off in our modern civilisation. How many followers do you have on LinkedIn?

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Animal views]]** - If we retranslate the three traits of the dark triad we could say the exclusive focus on humans, playing/using animals as tools, slaves, pieces on a board, and... Well, psychopathy still holds unmodified.
*   **[[Apathy]]** - Apathy is psychopathic.
*   **[[Big tech]]** - Big tech is mostly driven by people ranking high in the dark triad traits.
