**[Waste is anything discarded as worthless or of no use](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waste)**. To waste is to use something carelessly. The [majority of material waste comes from mining](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-waste-generation) and quarrying which, in 2019, was at around 450 million tonnes compared with household material waste at around 2 million that same year. There's nothing wrong with doing your recycling to play your part but just keep that disparity in mind.

> It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.
