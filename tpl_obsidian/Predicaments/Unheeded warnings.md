There have always been doomsday prophets on the streets. Why would our time be any different? Well, first of all, every civilisation that has existed has ceased to exist. Why should or civilisation be any different? Our civilisation is potentially different in that its collapse is running amok with a scorched earth tactic, taking many other beings with it. Several important trends have verticalised in the past decades, hinting at an exponentiality we have known about for a long time. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring warned of pesticide use in the 1960s, Limits to Growth modelled the outcomes of growth on a finite planet in the 1970s, adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere showed global warming as the result in calculations by Svante Arrhenius in the late 1800s, and other, less scientific warnings, have come from indigenous communities for centuries and even millennia. Nonetheless, something has changed since the industrial revolution and this change has become increasingly clear since about the middle of the 1900s. What is this change? An explosive increase in the extraction and use of energy, mostly fossil fuels. Pollution aside, adding this much energy to the atmosphere of our planet makes every other catastrophic factor more powerful and reactive. **We have known about this for a long time but nothing has been done, quite the opposite, we have doubled down** on a path framed in STOP-signs, corpses, and fire, seemingly unable to stop or change direction.
