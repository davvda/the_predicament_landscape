Sometimes we lack simple solutions, adequate answers, and obvious paths forward. This can be tremendously uncomfortable but **it is crucial to stay with the questions and uncertainty in order to find the right path**. We are bad at this. Mostly, we avoid uncertainty at all cost, instead convincing ourselves and others of the certainty of wrong answers and non-solutions. There are no easy answers to the predicaments we face, nor should there be, since we haven't yet managed to find the right questions.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - We seem to be under the impression that our current way of doing things has several certainties and factors of control built into it. It doesn't, but that doesn't stop us from avoiding all radical options with their uncertainties. I suppose there is a point in our current path being certain, certain to fail, and the radical options being uncertain, uncertain in that it might take us onward. Certain failure appears more comforting than uncertain success.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - Uncertainty is uncomfortable. So we seek out whatever confirms our certainties.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Our inability to stay with uncertainty makes us too simple minded for the complex challenges we face.
- [[Dogmatism]] - Trenches get ever deeper when the climate above turns hostile and unpredictable.
- [[Genocide]] - A people perceived as a threat sometimes introduces enough uncertainty that the only way to be certain is to exterminate all uncertainty.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - The left hemisphere doesn't deal with uncertainty, nuance, and fussy borders. 
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - Maybe it isn't so certain that you will have a stately funded retirement? Maybe the state of things below the surface is so uncertain that even talking about retirement is ridiculous?
- [[Ignoring complexity]] - When we avoid uncertainty we avoid any chance of wisely considering complexity.
- [[Imprisonment]] - People whose behaviours are uncertain should be removed from society and placed within enclosures of certainty.
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Those who avoid uncertainty tend to hold naive opinions and views.
- [[National borders]] - A feeling of certainty is often achieved through control and clear borders.
- [[Scientism]] - Science is never certain. Scientism holds fact as the stable base of reality. Science without uncertainty leads to scientism and in a society that values certainty we should not be surprised to see science being turned into scientism globally.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - If you never learn how to sit with uncertainty you will struggle to make sense of anything.
- [[Suicide]] - The uncertainty of life can be adjusted by the certainty of death.
- [[The impossibility of UBI]] - For UBI to be deployed we would have to trust people. Trust is uncertainty combined with vulnerability. How do you think that fits with modern man?
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - The wild is complex, unpredictable, and uncertain. A Walmart parking lot is not.
- [[Unemployment]] - Unemployment being seen as a problem has partly the same reasoning behind it as the avoidance of UBI. Uncontrolled people introduce uncertainty and the requirement of trust.
- [[War]] - Wars have been started becase of the uncomfortable inconvenience of uncertainty.
