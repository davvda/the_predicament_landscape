**Debt is an obligation that requires one party to pay for borrowed money from another party**. The cost for the borrowed money is almost always more than the principal sum, the cost borrowed, since it includes interest. Interest is most often set at a particular rate, a percentage of the amount borrowed. Debt can also be anything that is owed to something or someone else, such as debt owed to coming generations due to our current and past treatment of the planet and its future.

Debt keeps individuals, businesses, governments, and other organisations and financial entities in a constant battle with the assumptions and attitudes about the future. It also makes any serious attempt to manage our predicaments potentially catastrophic since one must keep up with interest rates that depend on growth, assumed or actual, or accept bankruptcy.

Over the past many years we've been sent several reminders that our natural debt needs paying. The interest rate of global rising temperatures due to borrowing more fossil fuels than we can pay for has us staring global existential bankruptcy in the face.

> If history shows anything, it is that there's no better way to justify relations founded on violence, to make such relations seem moral, than by reframing them in the language of debt—above all, because it immediately makes it seem that it's the victim who's doing something wrong.
