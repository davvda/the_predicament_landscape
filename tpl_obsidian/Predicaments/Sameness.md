Nearly everything has been sucked into the global system of modernity. This global system has immense clarity in its optimisation, however questionable that optimisation is. To remain in the global system, which isn't truly a choice, one must then optimise according to that same formula. Utilising the same data and the same optimisations then leads one to more or less the same conclusions that every other entity in the system has reached, and a race to fully realise that optimisation ensues. In the blink of an eye the manifestations of human minds all look the same, asymptotically approaching the optimal solution to the question of how to grow and win. Buildings, vehicles, food, products of technology, graphic design, media. **We all have the freedom to be different as long as we follow the formulae which keeps us the same**.

For the future to be anything different than the present, a diversity near extinction must be resuscitated and allowed to flourish, variety and difference allowed to emerge, and the sameness of individualism organically replaced with cultural complexity.
