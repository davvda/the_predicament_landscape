We used to live in small self-sufficient communities that held life together with a firm but open hand. Food, medicine, clean water, nature, family, friends, elders, children, social gatherings, craftsmen, artists, builders, makers, all were contained locally in one place. Sure, food production is more efficient, allegedly, if centralised, medical practices are better off, allegedly, when put into massive hospital structures, more clean water can be... etc etc. I might sometimes, rightfully, be blamed for wearing rose-tinted glasses when looking at the past. However, I am simply attempting to look past through the drug-infused haze of modernity. **Something is lost when nothing is local, something much larger than anything gained through efficiency and scale**.
