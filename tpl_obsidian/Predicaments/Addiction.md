**[Addictions are disorders characterised by a persistent and intense urge to use a substance and/or engage in a behaviour that produces natural reward, despite whatever negative consequences it may have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction)**.

Everyone who reads this will most likely be addicted to something, and I'm not saying that particularly lightly. Craving without self-control is the bread and butter of capitalism. Alcohol and the "typical" drugs, but also food, sugar, shopping, gambling, porn, sex, social media, games, medications, entertainment, TV, work, thought, fantasy, spiritual, pain, money, exercise, etc. Addiction is the ideal driver of stable, predictable, and sustained consumption and behaviour and, furthermore, **an addicted population will exhibit an intrinsic control system towards a life that is in balance with their addiction**, rarely deviating too far in any direction. It must surely be rare that heroin addicts protest against the manufacturing of heroin?

- [[Advertising]] - Nothing is easier than advertising to addicted people. 
- [[Algorithmic curation]] - What people are addicted to drives what the algorithms prioritise showing.
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - It is rare that an addict, of their own volition, will choose the radical option that opposes their substance of choice.
- [[Blaming the people]] - Corporations give people what they want. Nothing more, nothing less. Right?
- [[Chasing happiness]] - We chase happiness in a multitude of ways, mostly by haphazardly running in the wrong directions, guided by our habitual patterns and addiction behaviours.

- [[Emotional crisis]] - Living trapped, hanging in a shibari web of  tightly wound addictions is emotionally quite taxing.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - How does one even begin to take responsibility for one's part in these systemic webs of manufactured addictions?
- [[Hyperstimuli]] - More, more, and more. We have developed gross tolerances to the addictions of modernity. Porn dipped in sugar deep fried in tallow.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - The spice must flow, and as long as it does there are few reasons to look up.
- [[Immoral justifications]] - Just because there exists demand does not mean one can justify supply. Few lines are drawn to circle in the machine of profit. Make shame great again.
- [[Lack of agency]] - To be an addict is to constantly slip down a hole with smooth edges and nothing to grab onto.
- [[Laws]] - The few undesirable addictions of modernity need to be firmly controlled.
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - Global systemic addictions are homogenising human cultures. 
- [[Malnutrition]] - Sugar and fat have historically and evolutionarily been indications of high nutritional value and nutrient density. We have turned this on its head but, as with most things, our instinctive natural behaviours remain.

- [[Poverty]] - Addicts tend to be or become poor, spending the little they have on their substance of choice. 
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Breaking Bad is a family-friendly analogy for capitalism.
- [[Profit]] - Addiction is the most stable and predictable generator of profit.
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]] - Few modern addictions require you to get up from the couch.
- [[Selfishness]] - If the air pressure in the cabin drops, make sure you snort your own line of cocaine before helping a fellow passenger.
- [[Sex and sexuality]] - Where to even begin with this link? As an 11-year old I had never had alcohol, never smoked, never even seen any hard drug. But hardcore porn was easily accessible. Confusing, but accessible.
- [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] - The signals we're addicted to are all noise.
- [[Social media]] - At the birth of social media we were so adorably naive. You're just scrolling on TikTok to keep in touch with distant relatives, I know.
- [[Views on human nature]] - Why are we *this* way? Simply because we *are* this way? We can be *any* way.
- [[Weber's iron cage]] - Keep chugging away or you won't get your fix.
- [[Yuppie dystopia]] - Well, I'll have you know, microdosing actually helps with my productivity. Start locking in or you'll spend your life clocking in, y'know?
