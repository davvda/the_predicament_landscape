**A government is a system and/or group ruling a community**. The purpose of government is to steer and direct the community it serves/rules. There exist several types of governmental systems, each of which presents its own predicaments and problems. Governments rule mainly through creating and enforcing laws.

> Governments want efficient technicians, not human beings, because human beings become dangerous to governments – and to organized religions as well. That is why governments and religious organizations seek to control education.
