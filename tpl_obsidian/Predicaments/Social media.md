**[Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing, and aggregation of content, ideas, and interests through virtual communities and networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media)**. The art of living has become an act of performance. Social media's initial ([claimed](https://bengrosser.com/projects/order-of-magnitude/)) goal to bring the people of the world closer together has managed, better than any other initiative, to do the exact opposite. Never before have you been able to have hundreds or thousands of friends without anyone being able to water your plants while you're away. Social media does, of course, have its positives, but I would argue many of its positives have become necessities because of the world social media has created. Social media and our constant connectivity has allowed us to move away from family and friends while still being _in touch_.
