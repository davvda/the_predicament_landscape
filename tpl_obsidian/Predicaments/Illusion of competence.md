While having coffee with a friend of mine, a PhD in economic history, he told me about a way one of his professors had explained the complexity of economics and causality. The professor asked my friend to imagine a room filled with crisscrossing ropes and trusses, creating a massive spider web of ropes in all directions. When you pulled one rope several other ropes would move in unexpected strange ways and if told to move a select few ropes in a certain way something always seemed to ruin it. Modern civilisation has remained seated in a small room with closed windows and doors, feeling competent in what to pull, completely ignorant of the fact that all ropes reach out through cracks in the walls, floor, and ceiling. Yet we sit there pulling and pulling and everything, well, everything seems great.

To be competent is to have the ability to do something well or efficiently. We, **the people of modern civilisation, are extremely competent at believing we're competent when we're not**. We are the least competent and the most helpless version of humans the earth has seen.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Being reasonable]] - We think being reasonable is something we've mastered. It's not.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - We are under the impression that our sources are unbiased and simply true. They're not.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - If you believe you're more competent than the average person, you might be eligible for a bullshit job. Congratulations.
- [[Debt]] - I'm sure we'll figure it out somehow.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - How can we claim that something that was never in our control is under control?
- [[Dogmatism]] - Believe you're competent and you likely also believe you're knowledgeable.
- [[Educational crisis]] - Blind leading the blind? Maybe a more accurate metaphor would be blind blind-folding the young, I don't know. 
- [[Energy]] - All that's needed is increased funding to designing and constructing those highly efficient thorium reactors and investing more in hydrogen-fuelled cars.
- [[Evil]] - Much evil has been done with benevolent motivations filtered through acts of unacknowledged incompetence.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - We lack the competence to take the required responsibilities.
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - Faulty due to lack of competence, among other foibles.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - The left hemisphere doesn't see what it doesn't see, doesn't know what it doesn't know, doesn't sense what it doesn't understand.
- [[Illusion of GDP decoupling]] - Any day now.
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - We barely have the competence to start training our hearts and minds to begin to understand anything.
- [[Ineffective institutions]] - One thing I learned quite quickly when entering the so-called workforce is that, generally speaking, competence has an upper boundary, meaning competent people all seem to converge or approach a natural limit to their competence. Incompetence, however, is absolutely bottomless, unfathomably infinite.
- [[Information isn't knowledge]] - To stay highly competent, a "high-performer", you must of course stay informed. Have you ever met a competent person who wasn't subscribed to The Economist?
- [[Investing]] - Hah. I'd take the Mayan almanac over Charlie Munger's.
- [[Jevons paradox]] - Jevons paradox is frequently what makes up the illusory nature of technological competence.
- [[Knowledge isn't wisdom]] - Competence is knowing what to do and how to do it. Simply having knowledge might suffice for the how but not for the what.
- [[Lack of historical insight]] - Why look back when we, the geniuses of modernity, are the most competent humans that ever lived?
- [[Lack of humility]]
- [[Misinformation]] - Who do we listen to? Why should we believe what they tell us? Why should you believe what I tell you?
- [[Missing elders]] - Elders were probably made obsolete by the young which saw themselves as so obviously superior that others' advice was nothing but a hindrance.
- [[Naive progress narrative]]
- [[Naive techno-optimism]]
- [[No precautionary principle]] - Why would we need to be cautious? We know what we're doing here.
- [[No respect for indigenous wisdom]] - Our pedestal is now raised above the clouds, why should we care for those who still have bare feet touching the earth far below?
- [[Only 'can we' never 'should we']] - An easy question to answer when one falsely believes one *can* accomplish anything.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - We are the least competent of any humans in history. Utterly helpless.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Power should go to competent people, is that the idea?
- [[Rationalism]] - Do all rationalists seriously think they're rational creatures or is that a view reserved for the more autistic ones? Can we become rational? Truly? Would we want to?
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - First step is to recognise unknowing and incompetence.
- [[Solutionism]]
- [[Sustainable growth]] - Still waiting for a competent explanation of how it'd work in practice.
- [[Unheeded warnings]] - Hey, you gotta believe in human ingenuity, brother.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - First, the light must shatter all illusions.
