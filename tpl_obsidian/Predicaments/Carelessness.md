**Care has its roots in lamentation, grief, burdens of mind, and concern**. What, then, does it mean to care? Caring, in its most encompassing meaning, is the understanding and internalisation of the losses and deaths of any act or moment, the ambient awareness of the never ceasing songs of lamentation sounding across the world. When we are careless, when we are deaf to these tones, we bull our way through life without regard for neither life nor death, acting the role of the reaper we loathe. Carry the burdens of your mind lightly but, please, carry them with care.
