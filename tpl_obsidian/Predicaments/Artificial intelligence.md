**[Artificial intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)**. The general structure of an artificial intelligence is something that perceives, learns from what it perceives, and produces some output out of that learning.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]] - AI accelerates several processes but perhaps most notably it lays a heavy boot on the accelerator pedal on memetics. The convergence on certain cultural ideas that follow the mainstream narrative now move faster than the speed of human thought. 
- [[Algorithmic curation]] - The algorithms doing the curation typically fall in the AI/ML category. 
- [[Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight]] - Just listen to this, from [a paper on AI in the oil and gas industry](https://www.ijtsrd.com/papers/ijtsrd69438.pdf), it's just delightful: "AI plays a crucial role in promoting sustainability within the oil and gas sector by optimizing processes to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency, AI helps companies adhere to environmental regulations. Many oil and gas companies are actively seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and make their operations greener, and AI comes to the forefront in these endeavors." Here's that last sentence one more time: "*Many oil and gas companies are actively seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and make their operations greener, and AI comes to the forefront in these endeavors.*" Thank you, artificial intelligence, for being at the forefront of helping oil and gas companies make their operations greener. 
- [[Predicaments/Art]] - One of the grand visions at the beginning of the industrial revolution was total automation of menial tasks, manual labour, and inhuman business necessities. Admirable, I think. What accompanied this vision was the goal that all humans of an advanced industrial society would have more time for art, culture, hobbies, family, friends, leisure, and joy, while the machines did the work that held up the foundations of welfare. Interestingly, one of the first areas to be infiltrated by AI, now seen everywhere, is art. And, conversely, I've had few if any work-related actions that felt truly meaningful in any sense of the word. My sincere condolences to the benevolent early industrialists rolling in their graves, we seem to have it all backwards, our jobs are menial, meaningless, and take up more of our time and, meanwhile, we've handed the writing of poetry and books, the illustrating and painting of images, and the composing and playing of music over to the machines.
- [[Attention hijacking]] - An AI-model can learn what grabs your attention and optimise for it.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - The only evidence available to a digital entity is the evidence available digitally. 
- [[Big tech]] - For close to a decade at this point, the few dominating tech companies, despite their differing surface textures, have all become AI companies deep down.
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - As more and more information is created or modified by AI we're approaching a situation where the digital realm has become a memetic echo chamber independent of human interaction. It has already become difficult to know what is true. You might argue that truth will always be and has always been elusive, and I would agree, but somehow on the spectrum of truth-telling there is something broken when an infinite album of photos can contain realistic depictions of bird species that don't exist.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - AI was supposed to save us from the bullshit, yet here we are, drowning in it. 
- [[Capitalism]] - AI drives modern capitalism, a speeding tireless car running on fumes. 
- [[Catastrophic risks]] - AI as a term includes many things and I will not delve deeply into any intricacies. An example to illustrate will suffice: One way that AI moves us towards catastrophic risks is that it can provide *anyone* with [the information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9) and simple [tools](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7310294/) to wipe out humanity. Every single time you read about an advancement or discovery made through the use of AI, try to see the inverse, the hidden side. 
- [[Centralisation]] - Currently, those who control the dominating AI-models control the information landscape. This includes the opinions you come to have, the ideas that arise, the people you come to trust who have spun into the same memetic vortex you're in.
- [[Democracy failing]] - Artificial intelligence models are just gambling against each other on the outcomes of elections and the voters are the pawns.
- [[Disinformation]] - Just say it, and say it with confidence. 
- [[Exponential technology]] - Not only is AI an exponential technology, it further increases the probability of other technologies following a similar rate of change. Personally, I'm most excited about the exponential development of chemical weapons. We truly live in the best of worlds.
- [[Genetic modification]] - ["Overall, while the precise speed at which AI will continue to change clinical genetics is unclear, as are the overall ramifications for patients, families, clinicians, researchers, and others, it is likely that AI will result in dramatic evolution in clinical genetics. It will be important for all those involved in clinical genetics to prepare accordingly in order to minimize the risks and maximize benefits related to the use of AI in the field."](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-024-01782-w)
- [[Growth]] - AI provides one final push of growth before we all crumble.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Brain)]] - Not only are we increasingly left-brained in modernity, we've extracted an entire left hemisphere, magnified its narrow abilities, and defined it to be what intelligence *is*. 
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]] - AI gets all its information from the digital realm. The digital realm is not representative of all of humanity. 
- [[Ignorance of the mythical]] - How many myths warn against trusting the words of omniscient oracles, giving up power to the mechanistic and machine-like?
- [[Ignored externalities]] - The externalities, present and future, are hard to pin down. 
- [[Illusion of competence]] - Illusion of competence both with regards to the AI's capabilities as well as our capability to control and develop it towards good.
- [[Illusion of no option]] - There is no option but to win the AI arms race. You're either the sole victor or one among millions defeated.
- [[Illusion of understanding]] - Both the illusion that the AI models actually *understand* things as well as the illusion that we properly understand them.
- [[Inequality]] - Artificial intelligence will suffer from the same bias that the humans providing all of the data suffer from.
- [[Predicaments/Language]] - Yet another step in raising explicit language to the top. Give me an AI wise enough to know to be silent.
- [[Maximum power principle]] - AI has become the main battlefield for acquiring maximum power.
- [[Misinformation]] - Truth is not a concept concrete enough to be binary. For some odd reason, modern scientists tend to disagree. 
- [[Naive techno-optimism]] - Just imagine, AI can do anything!
- [[Naive techno-pessimism]] - Perverse incentives aside, imagine how these technologies could be applied for good. It might be an impossible non-compromise. But still. 
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - ChatGPT, our benevolent leader.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - Why should we have to know anything about anything?
- [[Pandemics]] - AI can help people create organisms never before seen by any immune system.
- [[Polarisation]] - AI pigeon holes you efficiently, and then often keeps confirming the truths you already hold.
- [[Propaganda]] - AI can create the most effective propaganda and customise it to fit different people.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Initially, AI might to a limited extent help people make sense of an ever-complexifying information landscape. However, the more information is generated by AI it will start eating its own vomit, spewing regurgitated facts about a world that never was.
- [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] - After Stockhausen I'm uncertain if there's been any signal in the noise of machines.
- [[Social erosion]] - Just look at the CEOs of AI-companies having front row seats when Donny rambles to the most socially eroded nation on Earth.
- [[Social media]] - Social media is where young artificial intelligences go to play.
- [[Surveillance]] - AI gets better with more data so it will always push towards increasing surveillance. Don't fret, it will be so sophisticated that you won't even notice how it knows everything you do.
- [[Synthetic biology]] - AI accelerates developments within synthetic biology.
- [[The death of creative work]] - The few jobs that still had hints of creativity in them are now being done by AI models. 
- [[The spectacle]] - AI rules the spectacle and sees it as the entire world, not unlike how many people live their spectacular sad lives.
- [[Unemployment]] - AI might lead to unemployment and, in a way, it has failed if it doesn't. Can we just take a moment, take a couple of deep breaths, and attempt to internalise how utterly stupid we are.
- [[War]] - Evil acts of such soulless efficiency deserve no trial. Lock Netanyahu in eternity and have him sift through images of limbless children to identify which are real. Fuck your gospel.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Few oracles simply boasted of their access to huge amounts of information. Can wisdom become extinct?
