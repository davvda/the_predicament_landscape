**Solutionism generally views all problems as engineering or technology problems**, that all problems can be solved through a technological fix. The problems solutionism tends to solve are generally caused by the technological fixes that were used to solve the previous problem. With solutionism's basis being the reductionistic and mechanistic view of the world, what tends to happen is that each solution brings unforeseen externalities that require further solving. The way solutionism expresses itself today, often as a "kicking the bucket" situation, is one of the main reasons why I've decided on discussing predicaments rather than problems. There will be no solutions or technological fixes for this landscape.

In Wendell Berry's essay Solving for Pattern, he identifies three categories of how we solve problems, two of which are the most commonly employed in modern times:

1. Solutions that cause "a ramifying series of new problems, the only limiting criterion being, apparently, that the new problems should arise beyond the purview of the expertise that produced the solution".
2. Solutions that "immediately worsens the problem it is intended to solve, causing a hellish symbiosis in which problem and solution reciprocally enlarge one another in a sequence that, so far as its own logic is concerned, is limitless".
3. Solving for patterns, meaning solutions which cause a ramifying series of solutions. The good and holistically considered version of the second type of solution.
