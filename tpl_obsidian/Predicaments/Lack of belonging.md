**Do you belong somewhere?** Do the birds miss you when they leave before the leaves change? Do the fields wonder where your footprints strayed when you're away? Is the moonlight in search of your shadow when you're gone? Does the sun rise hesitatingly, wonder whether to start the day before you've arrived?

Few of us modern humans can imagine the feeling of belonging that has dominated most of our species' history, I sure can't. Sometimes I feel a hint of it, like a drop of brackish water on the tip of my tongue, promising an ocean of eternal belonging somewhere beyond the archipelago.

We, as humans, require our people, our place, and a clarity of our role in it all. Most importantly, away from all abstraction, we require a feeling of belonging.
