The few elders that exist today speak to deaf ears and modernity is not creating more of them. **Elders keep cultures together**, the binders of links in the chain of time, the silent and sonorous transmitters of wisdom, the generators of future elders. Without elders we are both blind, deaf, and functionally mute.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   [[Unbalanced longtermism]]
*   [[Delusional domination of nature]]
*   [[Directionlessness]]
*   [[Educational crisis]]
*   [[Ignorance of the mythical]]
*   [[Knowledge isn't wisdom]]
*   [[Lack of communities]]
*   [[Lack of cultural control systems]]
*   [[Lack of historical insight]]
*   [[Lack of masculine and feminine]]
*   [[No respect for indigenous wisdom]]
*   [[Predicaments/Parenting]]
