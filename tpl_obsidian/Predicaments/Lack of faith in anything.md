To lack faith is to lack the belief that there is any possibility of betterment, redemption, to lack trust in someone or something to make itself present. It also means lacking the confidence of what should result from certain actions. **Without faith in a process of development one gets nowhere**, but then again maybe finding that faith is a part of the process. In early Buddhism, faith focused on the triratna, the so called three jewels. These could, in a broader context, be seen as the faith in the good, the faith in the teachings of the good, and the community seeking to learn from that teaching. Even more generally, do you believe there is a divine good within? Do you believe this good moves us towards certain actions and views when the mind is still? Do you believe there are others with you in this? I hope there are readers who answer yes to this.
