GDP decoupling tends to mean the decoupling of GDP (or growth) from carbon emissions. Taking a broader view would mean **decoupling GDP from any long-term detrimental externalities**. Taking an even broader view could mean increasing global welfare without increasing long-term detrimental externalities and, despite the predicament's title, this is not an unreasonable goal for humanity to have for the coming years, ideally maintaining or increasing welfare while decreasing externalities. Now that is an impressive optimisation challenge if I've ever seen one.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]] - With the assumption that GDP will *eventually* be decoupled from harm, there is nothing signalling you to ease off the accelerator.
- [[Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight]] - The growth imperative will only forcibly be put to a halt when the sun notices that we've spent her retirement funds.
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - Radical options appear all too radical when living under the illusion of GDP decoupling. Why slow down when nothing stands in our path?
- [[Biased evidence selection]]
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Is the idea to decouple GDP from reality?
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - If GDP can be decoupled from harm then anything that increases GDP, no matter how meaningless and menial, can be said to be an ultimate good for humanity. Hear that, Franz?
- [[Business-as-usual narrative]] - The corner stone of the narrative.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]] - Laughably narrow-minded. So what are these tears?
- [[Carelessness]]
- [[Catastrophic risks]] - "Taking no action to solve these problems is equivalent of taking strong action. Every day of continued exponential growth brings the world system closer to the ultimate limits of that growth. A decision to do nothing is a decision to increase the risk of collapse." - Limits to Growth
- [[Climate footprints]] - Carbon accounting, climate footprints, climate compensation, the inventiveness of those stuck upholding this illusion rivals that of children making the same joke wondering why the adults' laughs change timbre.
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - I'm truly sorry that the optimisation equation isn't to minimise emissions and maximise literally everything or anything else. The more complex a problem seems the more adamant we become in sticking to the simplest explanation and non-solution.
- [[Consumerism]] - “The fantasy being that western consumerism, far from being intrinsically implicated in systemic global inequalities, could itself solve them. All we have to do is buy the right products.” - Mark Fisher

- [[Directionlessness]] - Up, bigger, more.
- [[Electric vehicle solutions]]
- [[Energy consumption increasing]] - As long as it's green and clean, yes?
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - Believing that at some magic moment in the future the current harm of your actions will be lessened is not in any way taking responsibility for those actions. Punching with one hand and offering an aspirin with the other.
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - If I try to look benevolently at our actions and intentions I guess that growth has been a useful proxy for good, at least within a narrow exclusively human definition of progress.
- [[Greenwashing]]
- [[Growth]] - It's tough being an economy at a moment when our end is approaching and men shouldn't be shorter than 6'.
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]] - Unfortunately for us, growth is interconnected with almost everything else, not just carbon emissions.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - Even if we are moving closer towards absolute decoupling, we're a bit late to the party. The Paris agreement is already fucked and was never seriously intended to begin with... Nevertheless, "the emission reductions that high-income countries achieved through absolute decoupling fall far short of Paris-compliant rates. At the achieved rates, these countries would on average take more than 220 years to reduce their emissions by 95%, emitting 27 times their remaining 1·5°C fair-shares in the process. To meet their 1·5°C fair-shares alongside continued economic growth, decoupling rates would on average need to increase by a factor of ten by 2025."

- [[Ignored externalities]] - Bingo.
- [[Ignoring complexity]] - More good, less bad. The pinnacle of civilisation.
- [[Illusion of no option]]
- [[Immoral justifications]] - Continuance at any cost.
- [[Lack of balance]]
- [[Lack of time]] - Looking at the current rate of potential relative and absolute decoupling, were it possible, we do not have the time.
- [[Limits to growth]] - We already feel the limits' membranes enveloping us.
- [[Material extraction]] - So far, there have been no signs of a resource decoupling. Whatever, I'm certain we'll tackle that when we've got carbon emissions under control.
- [[Misinformation]] - If you keep buying Patagonia I think you'll eventually be wholly decoupled. Keep grabbing those crimps, buddy.
