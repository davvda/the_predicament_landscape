**Agency is the capacity to act**, [to effectively set in motion, powerfully incite action](https://www.etymonline.com/word/agency). From the smallest scale of single human decisions to decisions on planetary scale, we often seem to lack agency or, at the very least, lack a belief in our agency. Agency is also, more specifically, [the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency). It is, in other words, independent from the direct context and events of your situation. You can always increase your agency in some way, find how and where you're capable of action.

If nothing else, learning to accept situations where you experience a lack of agency can lead to an internal agency of thought that suddenly changes everything. There are no moments that completely lack agency, you just have to notice it.
