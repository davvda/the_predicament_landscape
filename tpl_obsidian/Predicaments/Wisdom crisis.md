**Wisdom is the embodied synthesis of understanding**, the ability to contemplate and act out of knowledge, experience, intuition, insight and lived self-transcendence. Are we truly homo sapiens? Sapientia means wisdom and has its roots in the Latin verb sapere meaning "to discern, taste, or know". If we were once homo sapiens we are now morphing into its lesser ancestor, homo cogitans. The thinking man. Soon we might not even be that. Wisdom comes with the oughts that the knowing's is-es cannot arrive at.

People of our present and our past have planted trees of wisdom, trees which we must care for while we water our own saplings, envisioning a distant future of blooming bliss, children playing in the shade beneath their crowns, elders savouring the scent of their flowers, birds like gusts of wind over their tops, golden sunrise over woods of wisdom.
