**There has occurred a narrowing of the future, a closing off**. Instead of a future open with possibilities and visions of beauty, we seem resigned to the direction of our inertia. The visions that do exist seem hubristic and speaks to an ever shrinking minority of optimistic elites. Few people envision a distant future of peace, prosperity, beauty, wisdom, science, brilliance, love, community, friendship, and coherence. Is the future so dark that it denies vision? We must then withdraw from the order of events and create visions whose light comes from within, see them before they're visible.
