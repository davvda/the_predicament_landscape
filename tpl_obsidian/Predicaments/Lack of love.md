> What is required is an attentive response to something real and other than ourselves, of which we have only inklings at first, but which comes more and more into being through our response to it – if we are truly responsive to it. We nurture it into being; or not. In this it has something of the structure of love.

I feel more hesitant towards writing about this predicament than any of the others. I do not want to explain what love is, define it, pin it down. Nor do I really want to dig into the consequences of its absence. Call it what you will but everything within me senses a gravity to this predicament, a point of singularity in the landscape. **The absence of love leaves us more blind than the absence of light**.
