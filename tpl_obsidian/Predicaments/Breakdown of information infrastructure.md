The algorithmic recommendation systems of the internet in general and social media in particular is leading to a breakdown in information infrastructure, **hindering the flow of truthful information** in favour of whatever stirs emotion and increases engagement and retention. Modern informational systems rely on capturing and holding attention in order to stay financially competitive. These incentives are detrimental to our information infrastructures. Further, the way we gather information about the world has failed to keep up with modernity's exponential increase in complexity.

- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Even though the complexity mismatch predicament refers to a mismatch between the complexity of different interacting systems, there is also a complexity mismatch between the required level of complexity of information about the state of things and the overly simplified information we're mostly fed. But then again, I might just be too much of an idealist. Even this landscape is too simplified.
