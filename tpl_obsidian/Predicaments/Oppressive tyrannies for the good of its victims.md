> Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult.

It is sometimes said that modern nations have two governmental options: **chaos or oppression**. As clear examples, China has chosen oppression and USA has chosen chaos. Of course, there are other alternatives in the spectrum between those options and the one always includes the other.

The global economy, social media, and most societies are working under some sort of oppressive system for the good of its people. You are free as long as you stay within the boundaries of the systems you inhabit and, if the systems fail to convince you that they're for your own good, you will have to tackle the fact that they have a monopoly on violence and either force you back into freedom or fully out of it. Good luck to you.
