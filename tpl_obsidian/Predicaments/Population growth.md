**The world population of humans has increased from around 1 billion in 1800 to 8 billion in 2024**. This increase has mainly been driven by fossil fuels and technologies that have increased the amount of usable energy. Important to note is that the growth rate peaked in 1963 and has since plummeted, now projecting a maximum population of around 10 billion some time after the year 2050.
