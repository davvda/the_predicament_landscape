All right, let's be absolutely ridiculously clear about this... Sustainable means, unsurprisingly, the ability of something to be sustained, to be held. Growth in this case refers to economic growth, meaning the value of goods and services produced by, let's say, all of human civilisation. For this growth to be based in reality its goods and services require resources, most likely finite, and most likely in an increasing amount despite technological improvements in efficiency. Sustaining growth based on any finite resource is not possible. Growing without the use of finite or, at the very least, slowly regenerating resources isn't either\*. In short, sustainable growth is an oxymoron, it is fitting infinity in a finite space, it is not possible.

\*Well, I guess anything's possible but it will not be possible in any world that resembles the one we live in.
