**Humility means an understanding of our place in the web of life**, a willingness to see truth, and an openness to the value and meaning of the seemingly meaningless. Being humble is being firmly planted in the ground of reality.

We humans have undoubtedly, in some ways, gotten far along certain paths of progress or thought-manifestations. However, we lose our humility when our feet leave the [humus](https://www.etymonline.com/word/humility) of the Earth. A tree that reaches towards the heavens while forsaking its roots quickly dies. There is no honour in mere grandeur, we must keep our feet and roots in the ground of reality.
