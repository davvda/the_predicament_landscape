**Access to food means having access to the necessary energy and nutrients to live.** This means living in a place where one can grow fruits and vegetables, one can hunt or fish, raise livestock, forage and gather wild plants and fungi, or have food transported to one's location.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Access to water]] - Pretty clear connection. To grow food you need water. Also, there are people living close to thirsty avocado farms who don't always have access to neither water nor avocados.
- [[Addiction]] - The constant ease by which we can reach out for sugar and fat, historically connected to nutrient-dense, hard-to-find food, leads to addictive behavior with regards to our eating habits.
- [[Agriculture]] - Food being or not being accessible for certain people or places is one of the main drivers of modern agriculture and all it entails.
- [[Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight]] - The energy in the food we grow and eat consists of old sunlight in varying amounts, usually captured, produced, manufactured, and harvested with the energy of ancient sunlight.
- [[Animal views]] - Many connections here. Here's one. The ease of access to packaged flesh has made many of us mostly unaware or at the very least unthinking, unfeeling about who the flesh comes from. 
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - Most of the previously biodiverse places on Earth are now plantations. 
- [[Centralisation]] - The majority of the people of modernity depend on a select few producers to ensure their access to food.
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - How many contemplate where/what/who their food comes from?
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Are any of those who grow the coffee I drink whiter or wealthier than me?
- [[Consumerism]] - If it's there, right in front of you, grab it, eat it. Oreo trees were rare on the savannah, y'know.
- [[Cost of living]] - One's access to food has clear connections to one's cost of living. Perhaps Russia should leave Ukraine alone simply to lower the price of wheat in Europe?
- [[Dealing with death]] - Access to endless shelves of food whose deaths we are wholly unaware of. Fattened up and wrapped in plastic we'll live forever.
- [[Deforestation]] - Forests are unproductive. Whatever that means.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - We've really brought nature to its knees. How else would my stubby cheeto-yellowed fingers have time to write all of this?
- [[Despair]] - Places which, either suddenly or gradually, lose their access to food rapidly turn to despair when actions fail to remedy the decline.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - Access to food and our means of getting it is a main driver of our ecological crisis.
- [[Energy]] - Food directly gives us energy to live.
- [[Energy consumption increasing]] - The energy that goes into producing food varies a lot depending on what food is being produced.
- [[Genetic modification]] - GMO continues to be a method of increasing our access to food.
- [[Global supply chains]] - We want access to certain specific types of food which can't grow where we live so we import things from all over the world.
- [[Healthcare]] - How would healthcare change if our access to food changes? A lot, I'd guess.
- [[Hedonism]] - Food is one of life's greatest pleasures. It's also easy to overindulge when the accessible amounts of it seem infinite.
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]] - "What you people call collapse means living in the same conditions as the people who grow your coffee."
- [[Ignored externalities]] - What externalities arise from our access to food and how we get it? Oh, so many. The same goes for actions that create areas which lack access to food.
- [[Ignoring diversity]] - Soy and corn, as far as the eye can see.
- [[Illusion of competence]] - Since we have a lot of food, that must mean we're really good at producing it. Right?
- [[Illusion of no option]] - We need to eat. We have no option but to maximise this year's yields no matter what. This is the only way.
- [[Immoral justifications]] - How do we justify what we eat? How do we justify the inequality of access to food? How do we justify the inefficiency of energy consumption?
- [[Industrial slaughter]] - We seem to crave constant access to a lot of flesh.
- [[Inequality]] - The access to food is ridiculously inequal across our planet. Many cocoa farmers have never tasted chocolate.
- [[Insect loss]] - The methods by which we increase our access to food decreases insect populations and, consequently, eventually, their decline will reduce our access to food.
- [[Lack of a living world view]] - Growing your own food, even if it's just a pot of basil under a growing lamp in the kitchen, makes the world feel alive, at least a little.
- [[Lack of balance]] - As with so much, the distribution of access and inaccess to certain foods is out of balance.
- [[Lack of resilient systems]] - Producing ever more food always feels urgent enough to ignore thoughts of longterm access and food system resilience.
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - What is the longterm idea, then? A world completely covered in corn plantations and cow shit?
- [[Limits to growth]] - The actions required to increase and/or maintain our access to food is pushing against plenty of limits. Some have been pushed straight through, for now.
- [[Malnutrition]] - Malnutrition originates in what food people do or do not have access to.
- [[Mass climate migration]] - Previously abundant places, now arid, none left. Dry solitary olive trees once proud.
- [[Meat eating]] - If meat is cheap enough and easy to get, people will eat a lot of it.
- [[Mistreatment of animals]] - To increase people's access to food we mistreat animals, both in the farms and outside.
- [[Modern slavery]] - Much that is or resembles slave labour is employed to make food more accessible.
- [[Monocultures (agriculture)]] - Bigger, better, more, of the same.
- [[Monopolies]] - [The cartel on your dinner plate](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/iQVLU). Nespresso, what else?
- [[Net negative caloric extraction]] - We pour barrels of oil into a converter called agriculture and pray for a long term miracle.
- [[Nothing is local]] - If you could only eat food produced within a radius of a few kilometers of where you live, what would you eat? Ignoring the fact you might not be able to afford it, that is...
- [[Obesity]] - Humans have historically stayed healthy on a see food diet. Not so much in the present day.
- [[Out of touch with seasons]] - If we can have food imported from anywhere we lose touch with the seasonal nature of all that lives and grows.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - Modern industrial agriculture is more industry than agriculture.
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]] - To ensure or access to food we've decided to try to kill anything that might interfere.
- [[Population growth]] - More food, more people. To a point.
- [[Resource conflicts]] - Conflicts over arable land.
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]] - We don't have to physically work for our food. We don't have to expend calories in order to consume calories.
- [[Story of separation]] - You are what you eat? What, a vegetable? A dick?
- [[Synthetic biology]] - Food would be even more accessible if we didn't depend on unpredictable natural annoyances.
- [[The minimisation of all things wild]] - Ordered rows of crops from pole to pole.
- [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]] - Outside of my apartment window, far in the distance, are massive fields of wheat. I've been queueing for a spot of land nearby for five years now. I know those who've queued for 20. All for the freedom of sitting in a chair admiring your homegrown kale.
- [[Transportation infrastructure]] - Much infrastructure is set up to serve the global food supply chain.
- [[Waste]] - The way we have access to food matters greatly.[ It is estimated that up to 40% of food is lost or wasted along the value chain](https://www.wri.org/insights/how-much-food-does-the-world-waste).
