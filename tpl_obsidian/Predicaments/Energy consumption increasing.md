The last 100 years have seen an increase in global yearly energy consumption from around [10,000 TWh to 180,000 TWh](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption), **an increase of 1800%**. Oil, coal, and natural gas make up around 75% of current energy consumption. The daily energy consumption per person has for the past 500 years increased from around 5kWh to 58kWh.
