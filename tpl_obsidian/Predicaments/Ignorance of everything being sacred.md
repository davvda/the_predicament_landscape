In what way is everything sacred? Well, first of all, if any one thing is sacred then through the infinite web of life everything is sacred. Do you hold your own existence to be sacred? If you do, and you truly feel the interconnectedness of everything, then you are both a part and a whole of one interconnected sacred existence, the divine. What we do will always reflect back at us, it is therefore of the highest importance to recognise the sacred nature of everything and do unto it as we would have it do unto us. The language here matters not, rather it is the fact that there are forces whose _why_ is unclear. Life is because life is. Genetics only give an illusory explanation of the _why_ of life. The _why_ isn't speakable and is the basis for the divine, the underlying _something_ of _everything_. Everything, you included, is a part of this something and plays a role in how this something manifests itself. If you do not understand this you do not understand the sacred. However, don't worry, the sacred is not supposed to be understood.
