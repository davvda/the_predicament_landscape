**A community is often defined as a group of people sharing common interests**. Communities, especially local ones consisting of people living in the same place, have become very rare indeed. If humans are evolutionarily unfit for modernity with its speed, complexity, and scale, what, then, about our modern way of living as individuals totally lacking anything resembling community?
