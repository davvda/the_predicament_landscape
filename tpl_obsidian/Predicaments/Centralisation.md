**Centralisation is the process by which the activities of an entity become concentrated within a particular group** within that entity, especially activities related to power and control. This power structure creates a hierarchy where those situated in the higher group has influence over the rest of the entity. Centralisation can occur on different scales and in different types of entities and can have many benefits. However, when decisions that threaten the power of the higher group are required for the entity's continued existence things tend to get complicated. Centralised power in an entity also tends to reduce its capacity for complex responses to complex situations, the main reason for this being a lack of possibility for spontaneous emergent behaviour within the entity. We don't need a conductor if we've reached the end of our classical symphony, we need to listen and become jazz musicians in one large multi-faceted improvisational mess. _The next big thing is many small things_.
