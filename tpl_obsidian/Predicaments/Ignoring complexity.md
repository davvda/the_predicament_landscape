Ignore complexity and with time nothing will make sense to you, nothing will be coherent with your thoughts, consistent with your actions, in line with your beliefs. You will be a simplistic contradiction in a complex world working against you. **Complexity is the concept that bridges our mental abstractions with the infinity of concrete reality**. If your abstractions take no account of this bridging with reality you will hit that concrete wall at the speed of stupidity.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Being reasonable]] - Ignoring complexity sometimes makes one appear more reasonable. An example of this is that taking complexity into consideration tends to make for more ambivalent standpoints, a decreased tendency to take sides or commit to clear and absolute(-ist) views. One becomes, to many others, a confusingly unreasonable individual.
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - Things are simply too complex to be this simplified.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]]
- [[Catastrophic risks]]
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - Almost a direct causality here. If you, in the systems you design, build, and live in, don't heed complexity as a concept in some form, you will introduce a complexity mismatch that will end in catastrophe.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]] - "Yeah, what a fucking idiot Complexity is, and have you seen his fucking soul patch? Like, c'mon... What? ...Complexity is right behind me, isn't he?"
- [[Desertification]] - We might cut down forests and act like kind little hobbits and replant new trees. Lacking the ability to do anything properly, we ignore the complexity of forests and mistake them for herds of trees and we consequently get desertification as one possible result.
- [[Directionlessness]] - Consider complexity and you realise that there are many viable directions to choose, all of which can be good, right, and full of life.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - A crisis of simplistic subsystems failing to consider the workings of the larger systems they depend on.
- [[Educational crisis]] - Factories churning out kneaded brains.
- [[Educational systems]]
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - As a good friend of mine once said: we are all doing our best, and this is where we are. The complexity of modern life obscures all ethical, moral, and systemic responsibilities. How could you possible be held responsible for the welfare of the farmers that grow the tea you drink? Maybe you can't, but we're not even moving in the right direction unless you atleast start recognising the underlying complexity to all things you are unable to be held accountable for.
- [[Faulty meta-optimisation]] - I'm not so certain that people consider complexity enough to even arrive at meta-optimisation, barely even optimisation. Importantly though, if they don't, is that someone else is doing it for them, and I'd caution anyone not to blindly trust the seemingly benevolent intentions of angels asking for more wind beneath their concealed wings.
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]] - Interconnectedness creates complexity. Ignore one and you ignore the other.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]] - You do not need powers of foresight, all you need is the ability to see a step or two outside of the sphere of a single human need, such as food and what impacts our [[Access to food]], and it becomes quite clear, not necessarily that things are beyond repair, but at the very least that they're changing rapidly in undesirable directions.
- [[Ignored externalities]] - Yeah, there it is. The societal and industrial web required to live a life is so complex that most externalities remain ignored when we ignore complexity.
- [[Ignoring diversity]] - One goes with the other.
- [[Illusion of competence]] - Looks like things within your narrow field of vision are going just fine. Splendid, in fact.
- [[Illusion of understanding]]
- [[Jevons paradox]]
- [[Lack of a living world view]] - Complexity outside of its intellectual and conceptual side enlivens the world.
- [[Lack of resilient systems]] - Resilient systems are more often than not complex systems.
- [[Lack of systems thinking]]
- [[Monocultures (agriculture)]] - Simple and highly effective, is it not?
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - The naive part is the disregard of the complexity of progress.
- [[Naive techno-optimism]] - Same as the above. Nothing is as simple as it's made out to be.
- [[Naive techno-pessimism]] - Same as the above. Just because technological determinism is simple-minded doesn't mean the opposite is any less ludicrous. Nuance and complexity, always, in everything. Don't be dumb if you have the choice.
- [[No precautionary principle]] - "Why? What could possibly happen?"
- [[Propaganda]] - Making your message as clear, simple, and one-sided as possible and it's sure to penetrate into people's marrows.
- [[Reductionism]] - Perhaps unfair of me to claim that ignoring complexity leads to a reductionist view. However, I do think that if you want to explain things in the world while shunning the complex and infinite, reductionism is probably your jam. Just think, everything in life boils down to a select few neurochemicals bouncing around in your brain. It does? Go eat a bag of ducks.
- [[Sameness]] - If we impose standards and order, a glorious sameness, then we can prove complexity wrong, simply unnecessary, frankly uncivilised.
- [[Scientism]]
- [[Selfishness]] - Call me a hippie but I believe karmic complexity should be popularised as a concept to live according to.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Why is it that we struggle so with complexity? We struggle so much with it that it can't be just an intellectual incapacity but an almost willful and struggling opposition to it. Is it that scary to realise how stupid most of us are? What do we expect of our sense-making abilities when we refuse to take the first step? Positively baffling.
- [[Simplifications]]
- [[Soil erosion]]
- [[Solutionism]] - Imagine the humanity of a different world, this list of predicaments replaced with a list of problems, every solution bringing us one step closer to a problem-free world. Only, we don't live in such a world but still apply the same method.
- [[Tipping points]] - We can ignore complexity but complexity does not ignore us. I'd bet a lot of money on the fact that if society is disrupted by a very clear catastrophe with a specific tipping point, say devastating local droughts and floods, people will talk about the fact that the one thing we should've focused all our efforts on was drought- and flood prevention, as if the thing that went wrong was the only thing that could go wrong.
- [[Unbalanced longtermism]]
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Wisdom, the ability to openly encapsulate complexity without having to make infinity explicit.
