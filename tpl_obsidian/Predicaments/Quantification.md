**Quantification is the act of mapping observations into quantities, numbers.** It is necessary for the use of mathematics and statistics as fundamental paths to scientific truth and is often the main arguments behind claims of objectivity. Quantification is important but becomes a predicament when relied upon as superior to all other methods of finding truth, especially when quantification is used in fields that lack well defined quantitative proxies such as in the social sciences. In this landscape, as with many other predicaments, quantification has become a hammer turning everything into nails.
