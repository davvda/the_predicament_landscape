Anthropologist David Graeber [contends that over half of societal work is pointless and becomes psychologically destructive when paired with work ethic that associates work with self-worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs). These meaningless and pointless jobs are what he call bullshit jobs. Graeber categorises these bullshit jobs into five categories; flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important; goons, who act to deceive others on behalf of their employer; duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be permanently fixed; box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not; and taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it. Thinking about most modern knowledge work and it isn't difficult to make the case that they're mostly pointless. Now, not all work has to be useful, rather, this becomes a problem when the bullshit jobs stop us from doing the actual work that needs doing. If you're stoked about the financial incentive for a new mother to prioritise her work as an agile scrum master for an IT-consultancy over her child, seeing it as a sign of our time's superior gender equality, I'm unsure of what to say.

Some criticism of Graeber's work writes that "_bullshit 'taskmasters' and 'goons' such as hedge-fund managers or lobbyists reported that they were vastly satisfied with their work, while essential workers like refuse collectors and cleaners often felt their jobs were useless_". It is hilarious to me that this isn't written with irony. I'm happy to hear that lobbyists and hedge-fund managers find meaning in their work, it shows me that the plasticity of the human mind is so enormous there might be hope for change. Jesus Christ. Fuck off.

There exist many types of jobs where, if they all stopped, society would become chaos. There are also many jobs where, if they all stopped, not only would nothing happen, we might actually manage to avoid chaos. Although, rest assured that hedge-fund managers are still needed, what would we possibly do without them?

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Air travel]] - Not the clearest connection, perhaps. When we get the chance to spend a few weeks away from our bullshit jobs, we want to spend those weeks far away, as far away as possible.
- [[Apathy]]
- [[Artificial intelligence]] - If AI can take part of the load of bullshit you're carrying at work, you'll most likely use it.
- [[Bureaucracy]]
- [[Directionlessness]] - Onwards! Full steam ahead towards... Retirement?
- [[Distractions]] - Our jobs are our great distractors.
- [[Growth]] - Without the need for growth, how many of the different jobs of modernity would remain? Healthcare, food production, waste management, maintenance, business intelligence consultants, HR admins?
- [[Hedonism]] - Any crack not filled with bullshit quickly gets filled with mindless pleasure-seeking. How are people not devastated at wasting their days at bullshit jobs, evenings watching bullshit entertainment, nights on fitful undreaming sleep? There have never been this many humans on Earth, yet I wonder if there has ever been such a large fraction of humans alive not in any way truly living. So much wasted life.

- [[Meaning crisis]] - Unsurprisingly, spending your time on complete meaningless bullshit makes life feel meaningless.
- [[Mental health]] - Unsurprisingly, spending your time on complete meaningless bullshit makes you feel bad.

- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Just imagine, centuries ago you would have to wake early and trudge through mud all day just to get food on the table. Now all you have to do is... Actually, remind me, what is it you do?
- [[Nihilism]] - Beneath everything, there's nothing. Yes, of course, that is a fair conclusion if you base all your philosophical inquiries on modern jobs.
- [[Sedentary lifestyles]] - Sit at a desk moving pixels on a screen, come home, sit in a couch watching someone else arrange pixels on a screen.
- [[Spiritual metacrisis]] - Most jobs I've had have been utter torture for the soul. 
- [[Unemployment]] - How dare you avoid shovelling bullshit along with your peers? Are you not ashamed?
- [[Weber's iron cage]]
- [[Yuppie dystopia]] - Hey, we had an ergonomist come to our office yesterday, yeah, now I can have my deep work sessions last even longer without this stupid neck issue I've been dealing with. Turns out, all I had to do was adjust my neck rest slightly- AND JUST LIVE IN A FUCKING FOREST FOR A FEW MONTHS.
