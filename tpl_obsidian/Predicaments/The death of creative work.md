Corporations are sociopathic cybernetic entities that have the goal to grow by earning profits. Being employed by a corporation means that your purpose is to help the corporation create more profit than the worth of your salary. I'm afraid that's it. **Creative work will then need to work similarly to a faucet or an industrial assembly process**. The nature of most creative employment therefore erodes the source of true creativity and, if any creativity remains, that creativity will be used as profit-maximising fairy dust. So-called advertising. Due to the mechanistic and procedural process of modern creative work combined with the naturally intermittent bursts of human creativity, we see this field being one of the first fields to be replaced by artificial intelligence models.
