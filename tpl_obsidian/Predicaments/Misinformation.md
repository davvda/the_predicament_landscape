[**Misinformation is incorrect or misleading information that spreads without specific malicious intent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation). What should be classed as misinformation on a grander scale is a discussion for another time since it depends on how we define truth. As a predicament, the spreading of misinformation makes an already complex situation even more complicated since it can lead to behaviours that create unintended consequences, as well as the adoption of selective half-truths whose lack of groundedness only becomes clear when it is too late. Perhaps a controversial take, but I see most sources people trust to stay informed are excellent sources to stay misinformed.
