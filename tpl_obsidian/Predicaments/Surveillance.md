**Surveillance is the monitoring of activities and information for the purpose of influencing and managing**. With the development of information technology and social media surveillance has become more sophisticated and, for most people, non-obvious. A security camera watching you has a clear purpose and is often visible to those being watched. An algorithm trying to predict behaviour from the movements of a mouse cursor is a very different story.

> The Stasi, the East German secret police, at one point developed a technique of breaking into dissidents’ homes at night and rearranging their furniture. Doing it left the victim in an impossible situation. Either you tell people that spies broke into your house and rearranged your furniture, leaving many with the impression you are insane, or keep the information to yourself, and gradually begin to doubt your own sanity. Sometimes, in Palestine, you feel you’re in an entire country that’s been given such treatment.
