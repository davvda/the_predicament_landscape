**An externality is a cost or benefit caused by one party but incurred or received by another.** It is important to think of externalities not just as financial. More generally then, externalities are events occurring as a byproduct of another event. Many (most?) externalities of the modern economy are ignored and following the connections of current predicaments it is not an unreasonable claim that most predicaments are externalities to the current economic system.

**Outgoing connections:**
Here follows an incomplete list of our ignored externalities and examples of what these externalities can stem from. In a sense, this list can act as a miniature predicament landscape in principle:

- [[Acceleration]] - The [[Growth]] imperative of [[Capitalism]] forcing the development paths of all corporations and businesses.
- [[Access to food]] - [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]], in other words, the privatisation of arable land.
- [[Access to water]] - Modern [[Agriculture]].
- [[Addiction]] - [[Social media]] and [[Algorithmic curation]].
- [[Animal views]] - [[Consumerism]], modern [[Agriculture]], and the fact that meat is encountered mainly through packaged products in grocery stores.
- [[Apathy]] - Following the [[News]] and "staying informed" might give people an illusion of caring that can in reality remove all sense of empathy.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - [[Social media]] and [[Algorithmic curation]] strike again.
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - [[Monocultures (agriculture)]], [[Deforestation]], and much, much more...
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - [[Algorithmic curation]], [[Artificial intelligence]], [[Social media]], [[News]]...
- [[Cars]] - [[Architecture]], [[Transportation infrastructure]], and [[Clock time]] among others. We've knowingly and unknowingly designed our societies in order for cars to be necessities.
- [[Climate change]] - An ignored externality stemming from the very core of modernity? I suppose, if I must give a concrete example, climate change is an externality of our ways of extracting and distributing [[Energy]] as well as our [[Energy consumption increasing]].
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - [[Advertising]] intends to create a dissonance that can be alleviated by a specific purchase. Pretty smart.
- [[Complexity mismatch]] - [[Monocultures (people)]]. Even I thought I'd give the example of agricultural monocultures but I opted for the homogenisation of ways of being as people. As I'm sure has been written several times across this work, humans live in a sea of ways as fish live in a sea of water. The fewer ways that remain as optional paths, the less able we become to tackle novel challenges. So, yes, here we are. The highway to the abyss is paved with global index funds.
- [[Democracy failing]] - Whoops, who knew simply optimising digital services for user retention and engagement through [[Algorithmic curation]] could ruin democracy? 
- [[Desertification]] - [[Deforestation]].
- [[Despair]] - [[The Predicament Landscape]] and similar so-called doomer works. Sorry.
- [[Disinformation]] - [[Algorithmic curation]] optimises for what's engaging, not necessarily for what is true. I will say, however, that were algorithms held responsible for judging what truth means... Well, that is just a whole different ballgame. Regardless of this, it has become much easier to spread disinformation widely because of these algorithms.
- [[Ecological crisis]] - The eco-system is rarely included in discussions of [[Big tech]] [[Investing]]. 
- [[Educational crisis]] - [[Social media]] and, funnily enough, our [[Educational systems]]. Among others, of course. It's all vague borders and diffuse connections in reality, keep that in mind.

The case can be made for every predicament in this landscape being an ignored externality of something. You figure it out. Perhaps a better way of looking at this predicament's connections is looking which predicaments are most clearly unintentional ignored externalities? This is a tricky one. In a sense, this predicament makes it clear that there is a recursive nature to this landscape, unsurprisingly so since that is how reality comes to be, but complicating nonetheless in how it effects my ability to provide a satisfying explanation. Kurt, can I get some help here, please?
