Technological development today mostly lacks the so-called precautionary principle. **The precautionary principle states that when developing something one must first work to ensure that its coming into being will not be catastrophically threatening, and only build it when one is confident about this**. Modern technological development goes by the opposite principle. If there isn't definite proof that something _is_ catastrophically threatening one can develop and build anything. There is no possibility for hindsight after the development of catastrophically threatening technologies.
