**Empathy is the sharing and understanding of someone else's feelings** or, at the very least, an attempt. It is about relating to others through one's own experiences, picturing oneself in their position. Empathy is, if you will, the precursor to compassion. No empathy, no compassion, no compassion, no collective action to alleviate the sufferings of other beings.
