Inequality is, clearly, the negation of equality, which means something which is equal to, or the same as, something else. Inequality is then **when something isn't the same as something else**. It is only when we're treated the same that we're allowed our differences.

The modern, highly praised version of equality is the inclusion of everyone in the eternal climb to be better than others. A woman shouldn't be at home caring for children, mending clothes and cooking, rather, she should strive for the wealth and status that enables her to give that opportunity to someone further down the ladder, how generous of her. Inequality has been solved by making everyone equally inequal in one single hierarchical structure. However, even the equality of inequality is inequal since the ladder was built by and for white male hands and, furthermore, the higher up you are the easier it is to climb. Whoops. Oh well, nothing we can do about it now! Look at the cute poor ants down there, we should get one of those, Charles, they look so lively, full of vigour, bless them.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Access to food]] - The access to food varies across the world.
- [[Access to water]] - Ditto.
- [[Animal views]]
- [[Cognitive dissonance]] - Highly discordant. Either when you sense a strong similarity between someone deemed different than yourself or when you sense a strong difference between someone deemed similar to yourself.
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Benevolently framed as *us* helping *them*.
- [[Cost of living]]
- [[Debt]] - First comes the privilege of being allowed to acquire debt and then, if you've gone high enough, the privilege to never be held responsible for it.
- [[Discrimination]]
- [[Genocide]] - The less equal to your people another people are, the less you'll feel the recoil of firing. Here's a hot tip for anyone currently looking to commit genocide but whose suggestion is frowned upon: start slowly expanding the rift between you and the people you want to get rid of, give it a couple of years and soon your people will return to you, a twinkle in their eyes, asking you innocently if you have any idea what to do about the situation. 
- [[Hemispherical asymmetry (Earth)]] - Top tier inequality.
- [[Identity]] - Identities are greatly strengthened by identifying what *isn't* us.
- [[Industrial slaughter]] - I've said it once and I'll keep saying it: industrial slaughter is the greatest moral crime this planet has ever and will ever see. Most people partake in this crime, gladly. Choke on your own deep-fried tongues. No, sorry, it doesn't do to get too angry with hypocrites whose spines have long-since been liquefied. My bad.
- [[Lack of masculine and feminine]] - Inequality has been treated strangely. Somehow, we remain problematically inequal while our important differences and defining characteristics have been painted over and discouraged.
- [[Laws]] - Laws do not apply to everyone equally. Have I already mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize?
- [[LGBTQ+]] - A failing modernistic attempt at equality? Of course, the movement has been narrowly successful and undoubtedly important but its striving for full equality based on fundamental differences seems... I'm not sure. A creation of the same flesh as its oppressor's?
- [[Migration]]
- [[Mistreatment of animals]]
- [[Mistreatment of other humans]]
- [[Modern slavery]] - Mostly unseen. Don't worry 'bout it. 
- [[Monocultures (people)]]
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - The striving for equality and the notion of inequality arose during the enlightenment. Yes, surely, nowhere else on Earth, no other time in our hundred thousand years of human history, only a handful of French and English aristocrats could come to the conclusion that women are human too. Incredible. We've come so far. 
- [[National borders]]
- [[Obesity]]
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - Many interventions brandishing the flag of equality become tyrannical structures.
- [[Polarisation]]
- [[Poverty]]
- [[Racism]] - Inequality based on ethnicity and appearance.
- [[Sex and sexuality]]
- [[Sexism]] - Inequality based on sex and/or gender.
- [[Social erosion]]
- [[Status]] - Being different, hierarchically.
- [[Surveillance]] - Some are so different they must be kept under surveillance.
- [[Unemployment]] - Whose unemployment is frowned upon and whose isn't?
- [[Unpaid important labour]] - Labour is inequal.
- [[Views on human nature]]
- [[Violence]]
- [[War]] - If the people you fight are viewed as sufficiently different from you it doesn't even feel like killing. Swatting flies?
