The mystical rejects definition. However, were I to give the modern use of the word a definition I might define it as anything within or outside of science that rejects explanation and to which there doesn't seem to be a logical path. **Being ignorant of the mystical therefore traps us within the strict logical boundaries of science and, slowly but surely, mystical experiences will recede from our consciousness**.

More concretely, take an example, you are experiencing a sunset with everything that moment can include. Even if you try to explain the external event through physics and astronomy, or the internal "cogs" of your body and mind through simple chemical, mechanistic models of explanation, there is an infinity, an endlessness, in all moments of life. Even if you buy into the chemical explanation of the mind, isn't then that in itself mysterious and powerful? The alterings, inhibitions, or excitations of a few chemicals can make you love another human and protect them with your life. We must stay open towards the mystical rather than closing ourselves away from it. If we are to have any chance of living it is within the mystical we will find the path onward.
