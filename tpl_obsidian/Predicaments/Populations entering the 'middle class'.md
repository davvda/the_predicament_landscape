![](../img/middle_class.png)

As populations and the economy grows we see more and more people entering what is known as the middle class, **the middle of the global social hierarchy**. This hierarchy is most commonly based on occupation, income, education, and/or social status and the middle class is sometimes more specifically defined as, for example, the point where people have roughly a third of their income left after paying for basic needs. Another definition sometimes seen is the point where people can afford vacation and travel. Increase in available energy has led to population growth and populations entering the middle class further increases the energy required by the existing population. There is also a deeper conversation to be had regarding what the middle class even means and if the notion of "lifting" people out of poverty hides and neglects the underlying problem. A process of modernity concealing the underlying problem? Surely not?
