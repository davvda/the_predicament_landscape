**We might, with full understanding of our actions, willingly, have poisoned the water, the earth, and the air to the extent that it might never again be the same**. Even the consequences of the most benevolent large-scale actions might pale in comparison with the life span of certain anthropogenic chemicals, fossils of our stupidity, more common than grains of sand in the empty desert of the potential future we mustn't choose. Can we become healers utilising the same genius that created the poisons to instead spread cures?
