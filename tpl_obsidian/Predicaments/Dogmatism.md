**Dogmatism is the arrogant and/or stubborn assertion of an opinion or a belief**. It is often in practice the opposite to pragmatism which deals with actual occurences and facts, or empiricism which is the view that the only source of knowledge or truth is experience. A dogmatic individual holds their beliefs unquestionably as truths, commonly in the form of systems of principle and doctrines. A different way to look at dogmatism is as a cramped up, frightened, and grasping relative to faith.

- [[Lack of attentiveness]] - Dogmatism shields our awareness from being attentive to the validity of any opposing truths.
- [[Lack of systems thinking]] - Many things, even opposite things, can be true simultaneously. Different scales, frames, and perspectives. If you can only hold singular views, you're nothing. Dogma punks, fuck off.
