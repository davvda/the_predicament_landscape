**Be enough of a problem for modernity and/or the ruling government of your place and you're sent off to prison**, either until you can return as a part of the machinery or until you're deemed harmless to the global system. There also exist much more subtle forms of imprisonment, their membranes are only felt when you unwittingly bump against them.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Avoiding uncertainty]] - That's the main idea.
- [[Blaming the people]]
- [[Educational systems]] - It's not even particularly far-fetched to see schools as a form of imprisonment. If you want to protect kids - wait, let me try that again - If you want to protect society from kids, schools are a proven method.
- [[Hobbesian views]] - Treat people like savages and they'll start behaving accordingly.
- [[Illusion of no option]]
- [[Ineffective institutions]] - Is the point of prisons to reduce crime? Is it working?
- [[Lack of agency]] - Imprisonment is a loss of most agency.
- [[Lack of cultural control systems]] - See, with prisons and law enforcement there's no need for cultural control systems. Or it appears so.
- [[Meaning crisis]]
- [[Mental health]]
- [[Mistreatment of animals]] - How many animals are at this very moment in cages?
- [[Mistreatment of other humans]] - Those who mistreat humans should perhaps be the ones being imprisoned. On the surface-level, maybe that is what seems to be happening, but those who mistreat humans the most seem to only ever be judged to a prison of their own making. Or a golf course.
- [[Social erosion]]
- [[Suicide]] - Guaranteed exit.
- [[Surveillance]]
- [[Views on human nature]]
- [[Violence]] - It is said that early Swans concerts in New York would see them locking all exits and turning up the heat. They actually started off sounding like Dave Matthews and then gradually progressed towards the violent atonality they became famous for. Not at all a true story but it could be.
- [[Waste]] - There exist a multitude of ways to waste lives in modernity.
