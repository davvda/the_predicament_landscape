Most cultures of modernity deal terribly with death. Maybe it is a part of reality that makes the artificial nature of our lives too clear for us. **Death is a necessary part of life and the way we deal with death will reflect on how we deal with life**. Once again, we have trouble with the broader view, complexity, infinity, and eternity. Do not put death under a cover, protecting us from its presence, for we are all dying anyway and in death's constructive destruction lies neogenesis.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Business-as-usual narrative]] - Our braindead, comatose, 140 year old great-great-grandfather, kept in the most narrow definition of alive, for the simple reason that we've forgotten how to say farewell.
- [[Elderly care]] - Those closest to death are seen as disgusting. Death isn't contagious, is it?
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - If you must die, die gracefully with dignity. Or, at the very least, quiet and unflailing.
- [[Fear]] - Do not fear death. He is the mercy your most faint voices speak of.
- [[Healthcare]] - Anything to get people to not die. Having healthy and good lives, that's an afterthought for other industries.
- [[Lack of the longterm]] - What remains of your life after you've died? Do you scoff at such a question?
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - We shun death so much that it doesn't get to be a part of culture. A culture that doesn't make a big deal of dying doesn't make a big deal of living.
- [[Meaning crisis]] - Memento mori. In every moment.
- [[Meat eating]] - Fill your belly with the sinews of those who died in agony and you will rightly fear death as a worse end to an already dreadful existence. But an existence nonetheless.
- [[Missing elders]] - Why should I listen to anyone who is closer to death than I am?
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - In our progress narratives we can even dream of escaping death. A nightmare unmatched.
- [[Spiritual metacrisis]] - Several spiritual traditions have contemplation of death as a central practice. Westerners cover their mouths and noses smelling the pyres by the Ganges.
- [[Story of separation]] - We live lives separated from everyone and everything else and what we fear most is that final separation from ourselves.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Death is the condition for life, not its opposite.
