**The cost of living is the cost of maintaining a certain standard of living**. The constant need to pay the cost of living keeps many people away from life. [The bottom half, the poorest, of the global population owns 2% of global wealth, while the top 1% owns 38%](https://wir2022.wid.world/). When the cost of living is high compared to one's income it then becomes impossible to acquire wealth and, together with the debt from loans, one ends up in a situation that completely lacks agency and optionality, where there is no way out but to keep earning, keep owing, keep paying.

When we look for advice and tips about parenting we always make sure to avoid any American sources since Americans have so few days of parental leave that most of their advice centres around being a good parent *in spite* of the system you're in. Our country of residence is miles ahead but still not anywhere near what's required for longterm attentive parenting.
* [[Poverty]] - Introduce a cost of living and you've introduced poverty.
