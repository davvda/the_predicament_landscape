**Craft is work that requires particular skills and knowledge and, related to craft as a predicament, the proper conditions for such work to be done**. There are several factors impacting modern craft, threatening its existence. These factors might become clear when looking more closely at what craft tends to entail. In general, the artisan or craftsman spends time on two types of activities: small scale production and maintenance. Small scale production of goods by one or a few skilled craftsmen stands in opposition to mass-produced goods sold at prices so much lower than what the craftsman can charge to make a living. Maintenance work stands in opposition to disposability and consumerism at large and, further, the majority of mass-produced modern goods are rarely worth maintaining anyway.

The extinction of craft has deeper connotations for us as well, since craft stands tall as one of the most concretely poetic activities, the physical manifestations of human ingenuity. All work should strive to become a craft.

- [[Sameness]] - Craft inherently comes with variation, variance, variety. I am aware of my tendency to romanticise but what's the merit behind the standardisation and homogenisation of industrial manufacturing? And whatever its merits are, why have we chosen to focus exclusively on it?
