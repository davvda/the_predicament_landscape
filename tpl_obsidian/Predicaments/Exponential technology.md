**Exponential technologies are technologies that in one way or another follow an exponential path**. This behaviour can be due to a technology that spreads exponentially across domains, grows exponentially in use, exhibits exponential intrinsic behaviour, requires exponential energy, or sees exponential progress in its own development. The number of real and potentially exponential technologies has increased with the invention of the computer. Whereas the expanding use of the steam engine required physical parts and specific knowledge, information through software travels at the speed of light. Humans lack intuition for exponential behaviours and care must be taken for us to not invent and develop our own doom. _How to wisely handle exponential technologies is possibly one of our most difficult predicaments_.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Acceleration]]
- [[Artificial intelligence]] - Exponential increases in computation.
- [[Big tech]] - Exponential technologies drive the big tech companies.
- [[Catastrophic risks]] - Truly exponential curves are never good news.
- [[Delusional domination of nature]]
- [[Directionlessness]] - We must remember that *up* and *more* aren't directions.
- [[Educational crisis]] - When education tries to specifically adapt to rapidly developing technology landscapes it ends up always missing the mark, the landscape having passed its teachings on graduation day.
- [[End of history]] - Our history may end with a sudden verticalisation of the power of a single technological advancement.
- [[Energy]]
- [[Energy consumption increasing]]
- [[Failure to take responsibility]]
- [[Finite games]]
- [[Growth]] - Rapidly developing technologies is allowing the growth to continue for a while longer, riding on fumes.
- [[Investing]] - Either win, or lose.
- [[Jevons paradox]] - Whatever effect we think certain technologies will have on our behaviour or lives, it is rarely what we expect or hope.
- [[Lack of the longterm]]
- [[Lack of time]] - The most clearly verticalising curves of development are not benevolent nor benign.
- [[Maximum power principle]] - Whoever controls the most powerful technologies will be the most powerful people.
- [[Moloch]] - Exponential technologies play perfectly according to the power dynamics that Moloch is born from.
- [[Monopolies]]
- [[Multipolar traps]]
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - It's been said a million times but should be said again. Just because you're moving fast doesn't mean your going in the right direction. We need [a new way of talking about progress and development](https://consilienceproject.org/development-in-progress/).
- [[Naive techno-optimism]]
- [[No precautionary principle]]
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - In this case, it is more about becoming over-reliant on the promises of future technologies rather than the reality of current ones.
- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Power will go to the most careless, to those who reject considering consequences.
- [[Profit]]
- [[Resources]] - Technologies, even digital ones, don't simply run on courage and dreams.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - Humans are terrible at understanding exponential changes.
- [[Tipping points]]
- [[Unbalanced longtermism]] - Let's live forever on Mars!
- [[War]] - Accelerating arms races.
