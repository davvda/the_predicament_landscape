**Many cities are designed for cars**. As with many predicaments, car-centric design has a complex and recursive causality chain. The more common it is to have a car, the further the distances between shops, workplaces, etc, and the further the distances are the more common it'll be to have a car. Car-centric design has ruined and is ruining our villages, cities, countries, and much of the world and, frankly, makes the world a better place for cars than for humans.

Christopher Alexander et al. write in A Pattern Language, "The problems stem essentially from the fact that a car is so much bigger than a person. Large parking lots, suited for the cars, have all the wrong properties for people. They are too wide; they contain too much pavement; they have no place to linger. In fact, we have noticed that people speed up when they are walking through large parking lots to get out of them as fast as possible". What does their research suggest is a large parking lot, you ask? One that fits more than seven cars. Seven.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Architecture]]
- [[Cars]]
- [[Cost of living]]
- [[Electric vehicle solutions]] - It seems many are unwilling to think of cars as anything other than a modern marvel of comfort and convenience, an invention that must therefore be made immune to the societal repercussions of climate change.
- [[Illusion of no option]]
- [[Lack of dark spaces]]
- [[Lack of quiet spaces]]
- [[Loneliness]] - If places and spaces are designed for the distances cars travel, then naturally the distance between people increases.
- [[Madness of safety]] - With this connection, I almost see madness of safety as a justified necessity. Once again, if your child or pet ran away and there were no cars, what mortal dangers remain? A fox? Violent gangs? A stray catholic priest? Remove cars and any real accident becomes highly unlikely.
- [[Map and territory]] - Design the world as if it was a simple lined map to traverse from A to B and that's what the world will be for you. 
- [[Mental health]] - American suburbia vs. the meandering cobbled street networks of old European villages or simply the natural gravel paths created by generations of feet... Are my expectations for life unreasonable? Should I just sit back, shut up, and watch the race of the raindrops on the passenger window? I challenge anyone to live their life in a mall parking lot and stay sane. Though, if you accepted that challenge you've already failed its premise.
