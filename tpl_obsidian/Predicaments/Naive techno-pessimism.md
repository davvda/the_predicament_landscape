**Techno-pessimists tend to believe that none of the problems of modernity can be solved by new technology and, often, that technology in general is the main problem.** Technology in a broader sense is and will always be vital for humanity to have a place on Earth. We do, however, need to become wiser in our development of technologies, their tools, and their use. Technology is, after all, [_not_ values neutral](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/).
