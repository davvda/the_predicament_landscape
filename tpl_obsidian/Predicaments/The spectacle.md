The spectacle is many things. We are all a part of it and its borders have become fuzzy, its extent far-stretching. In the words of Guy Debord, the more modern man "identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and his own desires. The spectacle’s estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by the fact that the individual’s gestures are no longer his own; they are the gestures of someone else who represents them to him" and, similarly to other predicaments of presencing versus representations, "in societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. **Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation**".
