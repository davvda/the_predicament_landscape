We lack time in a multitude of ways. I would, however, separate our lack of time into two categories, one being _duration_ and the other being the prioritisation of the _present moment_. There is a feeling of impending doom in many people, that there isn't enough time to course correct, to halt global warming, to stop the machine before it kills us. **The future is shrinking**, we lack continuance of time, instead strengthening our hearts awaiting the crash with a [hardened](https://www.etymonline.com/word/duration) future. The second category, the prioritisation of the present, is what makes the changes that are required even less likely to happen. We, as individuals, communities, societies, nations, don't have time to spend on slowing down or halting certain activities while doubling down on others. We don't have time to not be employed, grow the economy, travel, provide, **we don't have time to not destroy the world**. If we must spend our time destroying it, how can we even attempt to prioritise saving it at any moment?

Of these two categories, I would implore you to ignore the former and focus on the latter. Eternity does not lie in duration, it lies in the infinitely complex web of the moment. To find a way forward, every step of every moment has to be radical and daring.
