**[The planetary boundaries concept presents a set of nine planetary boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html)** [and thrive for generations to come](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html). These nine boundaries are: novel entities, stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows, freshwater change, land-system change, biosphere integrity, and climate change.

As can be seen in the figure we are currently [beyond six of the nine planetary boundaries](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458). Important to note is that the notion of planetary boundaries can include other models than the nine boundaries above.
