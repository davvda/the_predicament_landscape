**Attention hijacking means getting someone's attention through force or trickery.** It is one of the most seemingly harmless but detrimental crimes against human minds that is accepted as normal in our modern world.

Attention is not merely a passive act. It is a creative one. What we choose to pay attention to is what will spring up out of new sources. What we choose to ignore will wither and die. The dominating culture of our time is a culture obsessed with doing. If we're not doing something we're not doing anything. I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the economies of attention to instead _attend, tend to, and show tenderness_ to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Addiction]] - Attention hijacking puts the ADD in addiction.
- [[Advertising]] - Attention hijacking is what drives successful advertising.
- [[Algorithmic curation]] - Algorithmic curation arises from the need to keep capturing users' attention.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - How many of your evidence sources have you found through active research? How much has simply popped up? Of course, there is always a selection involved but it is surely preferable that you've done the selection at some point in the forming of opinions? Are you just a memetic reverberator for whatever ideas someone puts in front of you?
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - Attention hijacking at its modern scale is devastating to truthful information infrastructure. Whatever that might mean.
- [[Disinformation]] - False information is often more eye-catching. Consequently, in a battle over people's attention there is then an incentive to hijack attention through whatever information does that best. Hijacking a plane depends very little on your pilot skills.
- [[Distractions]] - Our attention incessantly getting pulled in different directions makes us the most distracted humans to have ever lived.
- [[Emotional crisis]] - Attention hijacking can sometimes be spoken of as limbic hijacking, getting people to pay attention through triggering emotions, often negative or problematic.
- [[Fear]] - One of the emotions that directs our attention is fear.
- [[Hyperstimuli]] - Attention hijacking tends to drive hyperstimuli for the simple reason that our information overwhelm numbs our attention to normality. More violent, more undressed, more hateful, simply more extreme content becomes a necessity to capture attention.
- [[Ignored externalities]] - The ignored externality of our failed attempts at paying attention to the right things is the world as we see it, or perhaps fail to see it.
- [[Lack of attentiveness]] - Obviously.
- [[Lack of quiet spaces]] - Just leave me the fuck alone. Let my attention be my own to direct.
- [[Maximum power principle]] - Whoever controls a people's attention will be in the position of maximum power.
- [[Mental health]] - Why are the different autisms and attention disorders not talked about as direct results of the societal incentives of modernity? And further, what fraction of depressed people could be treated through a complete incentive flip towards benevolent and wise turning of attention? Fire all screens into the sun and replace all advertisement billboards with paintings. We'd be swell.
- [[Misinformation]] - As with disinformation, the truth is often bad at capturing our attention.
- [[Monocultures (people)]] - Attention hijacking has put a monochrome filter on culture. And I'm not talking Jean-Luc Godard, cool Parisians smoking cigarettes in a back alley café. What am I talking? A chessboard? No, more like TV static. In Swedish we would call that static "war of the ants". Absolutely enthralling.
- [[Monopolies]] - Our attention ends up in the hands of a select few.
- [[News]] - Attention hijacking has shaped news into what it is. Weather, war, and sport. News complexity should've stopped at [Sjörapporten](https://www.sverigesradio.se/artikel/6972723).
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - All hijackers seem to justify their actions by claiming to show people what they want.
- [[Overlay/Parenting|Parenting]] - Screaming, crying, begging for attention. Sorry, kid, you'll have to do better than that.
- [[Polarisation]] - Attention hijacking puts you in a hole and then keeps squeezing you deeper into it. You will be wholly unable to even see whatever the people of other holes believe about the world.
- [[Profit]] - Attention hijacking drives profit. If it didn't, few would do it.
- [[Propaganda]] - If you're not capturing people's attention for profit, you're likely doing it for power, and the power comes through the ability to propagate your agenda through people, nearly without friction.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - If we lack control over our attention... We will not be able to make sense of anything.
- [[Social erosion]] - We'll be scrolling through scantily dressed dancing teenagers on TikTok while the oxygen masks from the airplane ceiling remain ignored.
- [[Social media]] - Social media is largely driven by the capturing of attention.
- [[The spectacle]] - Attention hijacking pulls us away from life and into the spectacle.
