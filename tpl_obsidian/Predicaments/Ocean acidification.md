**Ocean acidification means an increased concentration of hydrogen ions in seawater**, meaning more acidic water. [The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html) and a series of chemical reactions means this absorption of carbon dioxide leads to an increase in hydrogen ions. The ocean turns sour. As we continue to annoy the ocean and destabilise it we are risking disrupting all life it contains and supports. To be blunt, this includes us and everything else. Don't piss off the ocean.

> It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.

*   **[[Biodiversity loss]]** - Annoying as it may be, not many animals would survive in a bottle of coke.
*   **[[Carbon fundamentalism]]** - Ocean acidification and the way we interpret its causes leads to us travelling further down the path of carbon fundamentalism, carbon emissions being the one and only problem to solve.
*   **[[Catastrophic risks]]** - We do not know what happens if all coral reefs die off. But it isn't good.
*   **[[Climate change]]** - There is likely a recursive connection between ocean acidification and climate change.
*   **[[Delusional domination of nature]]** - Get fucked, stupid turtles.
*   **[[Ecological crisis]]** - Ocean acidification is driving and driven by the ecological crisis.
*   **[[Extreme weather]]** - Acid rain sure sounds like it'd be quite cool. It's really not.
*   **[[Finite games]]** - The oceans are the foundations of life. Without thriving oceans all will end.
*   **[[Mistreatment of animals]]** - You're supposed to pickle the herring after you've caught it, y'know?
*   **[[Moloch]]** - Moloch is immune to corrosion.
*   **[[Planetary boundaries]]** - Ocean acidification is one of the planetary boundaries. Funnily enough, it is one of three boundaries we haven't yet crossed. Go, humanity, you can do it! Leave no boundaries uncrossed!
*   **[[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]]** - We are poisoning the ocean to breaking point.
*   **[[Tipping points]]** - At what pH-level do we see complete global collapse of oceans?
