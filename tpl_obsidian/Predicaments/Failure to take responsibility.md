How are we failing to take responsibility? Why should we be held accountable for our actions at all? **Having responsibility is having an obligation to respond for what one has done**. Every externally affecting action, which means all actions, should come with a promise back to the source of that action. Since we live in endlessly complex and intricate webs of causality in the modern world it is increasingly difficult to take responsibility and to even know and understand what to take responsibility for. How should you be responsible for the emissions of the airplane you're travelling in? What about the food served on the plane, the titanium alloys used in manufacturing it, the noise of the engines, the price of your ticket contributing to the continuing unquestioned existence of airlines, etc. There is a blurry line here. When you cross this line you enter the infinite fields of karmic complexity. Karmic complexity does not necessarily belong in this predicament. But maybe it does.

Largely, I believe the responsibility for many predicaments comes down, not to individuals, but institutions, corporations, and, most of all, human-created systems. As long as our systems fail to take responsibility for their externalities we will not manage this landscape. To be even more concrete, this isn't even a question of nuance and detail, it can be as simple as taking responsibility for one's own shit, literally and figuratively.

- [[Bullshit jobs]] - There are countless necessary actions that need doing by people who instead spend 8 hours per day on utter crap.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]] - Our failure to take responsibility for our actions often lead us to find shortcuts or the appearance of responsibility, such as focusing on carbon emissions.
- [[Carelessness]]
- [[Catastrophic risks]] - Which catastrophic risks are approaching that we willfully refuse to act on?
- [[Climate change]]

- [[Democracy failing]] - For a democracy to function there must be a sense of responsibility inherent in its citizens. Perhaps not a sense of responsibility for the entire nation but at the very least for one's part played as an active and participating citizen in it.
- [[Directionlessness]]
- [[Ecological crisis]]
- [[Educational crisis]]
- [[Elderly care]] - Just pay others to do it. Then responsibility doesn't even have to be factored in.
- [[Government]] - The main role played by governments in our time is displaying what a failure to take responsibility looks like.
- [[Ignored externalities]]
- [[Immoral justifications]] - Is it not your responsibility?
- [[Ineffective institutions]]
- [[Lack of agency]] - It is interesting that many conclude that there's nothing you can do about anything based on the evidence that you haven't done anything to try. Is responsibility so frightening and paralysing?
- [[Lack of feeling needed]] - Imagine if, similarly to what happens in war, your country recruited every able body and mind to work on regenerative agriculture, decentralised low-tech energy solutions, preventative healthcare, reforestation, cleaning and caring for the remaining natural environment, recycling practices, rural enrichment, bike repair, care of children, the elderly and sick, or, for those unable, and there would be many, forced leisure and rest until their spirits recovered.

- [[Power concentration to the wrong people]] - Power will be concentrated to those unwilling to be held responsible for their actions. For every second of self-doubt or hesitation, someone not as careful and cautious will pass you by.

- [[Tipping points]] - Keep your eyes closed and you won't notice the consequences of your actions until your stomach lurches upwards.
- [[Virtue signalling]] - It is so tricky to know what being responsible means that it's bes to just fake it to the closest approximation others will admire.
- [[Waste]] - When something you are responsible for leaves your control. That's waste.
