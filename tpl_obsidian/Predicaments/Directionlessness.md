> Where are we headed? Are we not endlessly plunging —backwards, sideways, forwards, in all directions? Is there an up and a down anymore? Do we not wander as if through an endless nothingness? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Hasn’t it grown colder?
> 
>  - Friedrich Nietzsche

It seems to me that, in modern society, on the scale of individuals to all of humanity, **we have solved the problem of direction by striving to move with higher speed**. Going faster and having more will surely yield progress, inexorably lead to everything being better. If you are uncertain, perhaps rightfully so, as to where you should be going it is unwise to tackle this by simply going faster. On the contrary, the less certain you are the slower you should move, instead focusing on getting to grips with your present surroundings. Even if speed, magnitude, accumulation, growth, and restlessness got you to where you are now there are times where you must cease the unceasing motion and consider where you're headed, where your direction should be. If nothing else, stop, find a high point and see what's on the horizon.

- [[Business-as-usual narrative]] - The narrative of no direction.
- [[Democracy failing]] - Many nations' politicians have realised that the populist way to power is to promise a direction towards the better past that never was. A past that seemed to have future promises, a past appearing to be heading somewhere. Is 1960s nostalgia warranted?

- [[Waste]] - So much wasted effort, time, so many wasted lives. All in the name of going nowhere. I truly am sorry for those whose rest had to wait for their own funerals.
- [[Wisdom crisis]] - Wisdom considers direction first and foremost. One small step in the right direction is better than a thousand in the wrong one. The wise know when to stand still, stay attentive, and not let the wind's temper decide one's leaning.
