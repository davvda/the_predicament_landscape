**Evil is the exponential externalisation of internal suffering**. It is an unleashing of inner demons into the world, their power multiplied by hatred, revenge, destruction, death, pain, apathy, and war. Every person must overcome their own evils.

**Outgoing connections:**
*   **[[Big tech]]** - Much of big tech is driven by evil intentions.
*   **[[Blaming the people]]** - To blame the people for one's own acts of evil or insufficiencies in dealing with the world is nothing other than despicable.
*   **[[Colonialist narratives]]** - Without colonialist narratives the colonialists might have to face their own evil past and present.
*   **[[Ego]]** - Evil speaks mainly through the voice of the ego.
*   **[[Fear]]** - What came first, the chicken or the egg? Fear or evil?
*   **[[Genocide]]** - Evil drives killing.
*   **[[Greed]]** - Greedful acts can be badly disguised evil acts.
*   **[[Immoral justifications]]** - There are sometimes discussions about evil existing at all. This is understandable when our vision is obscured by all of these complicated justifications for everything.
*   **[[Industrial slaughter]]** - The industry of slaughter is, I think, without a doubt, going to be regarded as the most evil act ever done on Earth in all its history by any being. It is a system so far beyond morality and goodness that it's nearly unspeakable.
*   **[[Lack of cultural control systems]]** - Many cultures have had clear control systems for managing and hindering acts of evil and instead cultivating balance and harmony. We are not part such a culture. Our culture(s) rewards evil as long as it is indirect and untraceable.
*   **[[Lack of faith in anything]]** - Humans can be many things. Evil is one of them. When humans seem inherently to harbour so many demons, what hope and faith can there be?
*   **[[Lack of love]]** - Evil destroys love.
*   **[[Maximum power principle]]** - Evil wants and requires nothing but ever increasing power for its own externalisation into the world.
*   **[[Mistreatment of animals]]** - To purposely mistreat other beings might be the definition of an evil act.
*   **[[Mistreatment of other humans]]** - Same as above but more complicated.
*   **[[Multipolar traps]]** - Evil combined with multipolar traps generate races to the bottom of everything. The corpses laying within the multipolar traps of history often wear their evil grins until they're nothing but bones.
*   **[[Nihilism]]** - Evil needs nihilism. To nihilists, there is no such thing as evil so why should it matter what evil one spreads?
*   **[[Nuclear war]]** - One of the most extreme exponential acts of evil is the detonation of atom bombs.
*   **[[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]]** - Evil acts done for good... What hell it is we are living in.
*   **[[Power concentration to the wrong people]]** - To seek nothing but power is often an act of evil. A surprisingly rewarding act for the people with the required competence.
*   **[[Propaganda]]** - To get people on board with your own evil it becomes necessary to make others believe in your agenda no matter how untruthful you must be to spread it.
*   **[[Selfishness]]** - Evil lies at the very apex of selfishness.
*   **[[Spiritual metacrisis]]** - The clouds are obscured by the ashen wings of demons.
*   **[[Story of separation]]** - The justifications and drivers of evil requires us to be separate from each other. Who knows, if people discover how much of their own feet they've blasted off, maybe they'd stop shooting?
*   **[[The Dark Triad]]** - The dark triad could also be called the triad of evil.
*   **[[Views on human nature]]** - We must not see human nature as something static whose proof of intrinsic corruption shows itself everywhere. Human nature can be and become many things and evil is one of them. Importantly, it can become otherwise.
*   **[[Violence]]** - Violence is evil. Evil is violence.
*   **[[War]]** - Evil helps you aim the drone strike.
*   **[[Wisdom crisis]]** - Evil grins and sneers at the powerlessness of so-called wisdom.
