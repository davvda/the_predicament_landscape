**To maintain is to keep something in its proper condition and, maybe more importantly, an expression of love for material and immaterial objects requiring care, time, and work**.

Alex Vuocolo writes in an [article](https://www.noemamag.com/the-disappearing-art-of-maintenance/) on the disappearing art of maintenance that it "distinguishes itself rhetorically from sustainability. Sustainability is a state; maintenance is a process. It requires work, and work of a certain type. Whatever its ultimate goal — safety, material efficiency, reducing carbon emissions — practical know-how and repetitive labor come first. This kind of pragmatism is sorely needed in the climate debate, which is so often preoccupied with end-states that it has no earthly or humanly way of achieving."

Maintenance might be one of the most important but undervalued types of work.

> The real people who hold our civilization together are the maintenance people. If it weren't for them - pumping water out of subways, painting bridges to keep from rusting, fixing a steam pipe that is 70 years old - we'd be sunk. If we got rid of all the politicians and the policymakers in the world, the world would keep going. If you get rid of maintenance people, the whole thing breaks down.
