Access to water means just that. **Water for drinking, washing, hearing, seeing, feeling, swimming, fishing, living in and with**. I want you to imagine your favourite body of water. Maybe a gurgling creek, a calm forest lake, a beach with crashing waves, whatever comes to mind. In your mind's eye, what do you see? Look around, look at the water's surface, if you see anything underneath, the movement or stillness of the water, what it reflects, how it refracts, if other animals are interacting with it, if anything is disturbing its flow or stillness. What do you hear? What do you smell? Imagine it in as much detail as you can or, even better, actually go there. Now listen to this: "Water is an inorganic compound which is transparent, tasteless, and odorless". The poetry of modernity sure is striking. No wonder we're so happy.

Access to water is access to life, bursting with colour, the taste of the freshness of being, the scent of endless rebirth.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Access to food]] - You need access to water to produce food.
- [[Despair]] - After lack of oxygen, lack of water is top of the list of needs which, if unfulfilled, will turn people towards despair and savagery.
- [[Global supply chains]] - Clean water is often imported, exported, and transported.
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]] - What do you feel when you stare long enough at the ocean? How would the elite make different decisions if, every day, their children played in creeks polluted through their actions? Direct access to open flowing water has fed into most historical metaphors of interconnectedness. If we've lost that access we will lose that sense.
- [[Lack of resilient systems]] - Our modern systems for delivering clean water and treating unclean water is a technological marvel, no doubt about it, but it's highly sensitive to disruptions.
- [[Lack of systems thinking]] - We're currently not acting as if we've thought through what we are doing to the global water system.
- [[Malnutrition]] - Water is the most vital nutrient.
- [[Mass climate migration]] - Places previously overflowing with both water and people, now deserts and deserted.
- [[Migration]] - People move great distances to access water.
- [[Naive progress narrative]] - Access to clean drinking water and sewage systems is definitely one of humanity's great achievements. Sadly, the cost seem to have been making every natural source of water poisonous in varying degrees. If every step forward has to be talked about in a narrowed sense, I'm not sure I buy it.
- [[Nothing is local]] - Where does your drinking water come from? Do you know? Where does your sewage go? I believe my drinking water comes from lake Bolmen, almost 200km away from where I live.
- [[Over-reliance on technology]] - Modern technology is quite magical. It is, however, a tad bit worrying that if we were to lose electricity for more than a few days, clean water would suddenly be difficult, if not impossible, to access.
- [[Planetary boundaries]] - Direct connection between our access to water and staying within planetary boundaries.
- [[Resource conflicts]] - How many conflicts about national borders are motivated by accessing water? For simply sources of drinking water it might sound far-fetched but considering land-locked countries fighting for a piece of coast?
- [[Spiritual metacrisis]] - If you live without being able to access open waters, bubbling brooks, meandering rivers, or quiet creeks... Well, where will the spirit be nourished?
- [[Tragedy of the vanishing commons]] - I know I'm prone to romanticise but there is something about small groups of people getting their water from the village's central well, or washing by the riverside.
- [[Unheeded warnings]] - There have been several occurrences, even in the affluent North, where we've gotten dangerously close to not being able to access clean water. Arrows are pointing in a direction where we must listen to these warnings and create solutions that are much more resilient to disruptive conditions.
- [[Violence]] - Places suddenly lacking clean water will rapidly have its people turn to violence.
- [[War]] - Wars have been fought over access to water.
- [[Waste]] - So much water goes to waste.
