**Public transport is a transport system available for use by the general public**. There are a few things that are necessary for a nation to claim to have a social welfare system. Public transport is one of these things. Public transport most commonly consists of trains, trams, buses, and ferries. Compared with other modes of transport public transport is generally regarded as significantly more energy efficient, it has the ability to move more people, it is cheaper for the passengers than vehicle ownership, and it reduces the overall amount of travelling vehicles. Downsides to public transport is a lack of transportation freedom as well as a difficulty transporting goods. There is freedom in being able to drive wherever and whenever you want with the car fully loaded with groceries that you drop off outside your door. An important consideration here, however, is that designing a city for private transport leads to people needing cars whereas designing for public transport leads to people not needing cars.
