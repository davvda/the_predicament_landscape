**News is information about current events**. Since news sources compete with each other for readers they must try to maximise the amount of readers and the retention of those readers as regular readers. This leads to sensationalist media with a focus on war, sex, money, celebrity gossip, or anything else that triggers instinctive responses in its readers, often leaning towards negative emotions such as anger. News also acts as the main actor in manipulation of thoughts, behaviours, and opinions of people and what the news chooses to report on forms people's concerns.
