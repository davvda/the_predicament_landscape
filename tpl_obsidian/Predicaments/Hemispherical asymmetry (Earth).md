There are numerous ways in which a large part of the world gets ignored or forgotten. Who has access to the internet, who is included in scientific studies, who is affected by climate change, who is seen as more or less human, who has the right to have opinions, who is seen as developed, intelligent, responsible, honest, beautiful, wise, whose existence is justified, who has a right to live, who has a right to love. What map projections we use, what poverty means, what places are important, what places need fixing, what places are colonised, what places are deemed to need industrialisation. We can make sweeping statements about the global south, the third world, western and eastern world, developing countries, yet **most of the "modern" world is ridiculously one-sided in its world view**.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Agriculture]] - Would agriculture be the way it is if its methods weren't developed by white people in the north to be employed by brown people in the south? Who cares about rivers filled with pesticides when they're *over there*?
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - At times quite literally. The conclusions of nutrition science is not that applicable to Australian aboriginees.
- [[Blaming the people]] - Is it not their fault that they struggle with poverty when trying to integrate into our obviously superior culture?
- [[Breakdown of information infrastructure]] - How global is your awareness of the world?
- [[Climate change]] - Our disregard for other people's places has greatly facilitated those actions that directly lead to climate change. A clothing manufacturer would never risk dumping their colouring chemicals in a Norwegian fjord, but a river in rural Bangladesh should be fine.
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Colonialist narratives]] - Surrounded by lobotomised missionaries.
- [[Dispositionism]] - Their suffering must be the fault of their own.
- [[Educational crisis]] - School gave me the impression that everything that ever happened somehow originated in Europe.
- [[Evil]] - Seeing some places as lesser than other places greatly simplifies the justification of evil acts.
- [[Failure to take responsibility]]
- [[Genocide]] - A people is of its place. When the dominating system's disregard for that place ruins it, it ruins the people too. Soft genocide?
- [[Global supply chains]]
- [[Ignorance of interconnectedness]]
- [[Ignoring diversity]]
- [[Inequality]]
- [[Lack of balance]] - Unbalanced and biased views can be devastating.
- [[Predicaments/Language]] - How dare they not speak English?
- [[Loss of cultural complexity]] - Most people reading this will only ever experience other cultures through the assimilated, domesticated, and internalised versions now included in the dominating culture. Wow, this place apparently serves authentic Chinese food.
- [[Map and territory]] - The Northern mapmakers have taken control of the entire territory. 
- [[Material extraction]] - One-way street.
- [[Migration]]
- [[Mistreatment of other humans]]
- [[Modern slavery]] - I prefer to call it an opportunity to escape poverty.
- [[Oppressive tyrannies for the good of its victims]] - Hey, savages, we're here to help! 
- [[Poisoning the water, the earth, the air]] - Some other place.
- [[Pollution]] - Some other place.
- [[Racism]]
- [[Resources]] - From some other place.
- [[Sense-making crisis]] - We do not, of course, have to understand the entire world. We do, however, need to factor in how one-sided we are when talking about anything spanning the globe and affecting other places and people. We will rarely think about such things unbiased and grounded in reality.
- [[Simplifications]]
- [[Story of separation]] - Us and them.
- [[Violence]]
- [[War]]
