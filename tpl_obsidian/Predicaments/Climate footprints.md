Did you know that Adolf Hitler was one of the main promoters and investors in a Silicon Valley scale-up aiming to allow individuals to be held accountable for the amount of Jews they indirectly exterminated? No? Did you know that the personal carbon footprint was first promoted by British Petroleum? Well, [there you go](https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham).

**Climate footprint, or carbon footprint, is a calculated value or index that enables the comparison of climate-related impacts of different activities**. The climate-related impact measured is almost exclusively global warming potential indexed with the unit CO2e, carbon dioxide equivalent.

A bit of inside information. I've worked with many carbon accounting people and they all have one thing in common. They spew more bullshit than they can carbon-offset.

**Outgoing connections:**
- [[Apathy]] - We sure go far to not have to care.
- [[Avoiding radical options]] - Anything to simplify and justify further missteps.
- [[Biased evidence selection]] - Our bias for the quantifiable skews our evidence selection greatly. Many would even claim that if you're unable to measure and quantifiy it, it isn't even evidence to begin with.
- [[Biodiversity loss]] - We can minimise our climate footprints and still make every other animal go extinct.
- [[Blaming the people]] - While Californian farms were watering their almond trees during wildfire season, people were told not to waste water by showering or drinking too much.
- [[Bullshit jobs]] - At the time of writing my day-job is working as a data engineer and analyst for carbon emission reporting. The word hypocrite doesn't even scratch the surface of my deceit.
- [[Carbon fundamentalism]]
- [[Carelessness]]
- [[Cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Electric vehicle solutions]]
- [[Failure to take responsibility]] - Sorry, lowering your climate footprint is not taking responsibility. 
- [[Greenwashing]] - In my field of climate analytics, I have yet to meet a company that cares more about actual climate-related action than the appearance of taking climate-action. I don't blame them. Wait, yes I do.
- [[Ignorance of ongoing collapse]]
- [[Ignoring complexity]]
- [[Ignoring diversity]]
- [[Illusion of competence]] - In Europe, some people might enroll in a quick course on CSRD and when they close the lids of their laptops they give a sigh of relief, they finally know what to do about climate change. 
- [[Illusion of understanding]]
- [[Individualism]] - You just focus on *your* climate footprint and we'll we fine. Also, make sure you carbon offset that trip you took to Iceland.
- [[Lack of systems thinking]]
- [[Map and territory]] - Understandably, when the territory is changing rapidly, people are stuck with their noses buried in the map.
- [[Misinformation]]
- [[Naive progress narrative]]
- [[Quantification]] - You know what they say about big feet. Massive footprints.
- [[Sense-making crisis]]
- [[Simplifications]]
- [[Solutionism]] - Minimise our climate footprints and we've solved this whole apocalypse thing.
