Duality of non-duality
The union of division with union.
Fractal yin-yang.
Holism.

> Then what is the answer? Not to be deluded by dreams. 
> To know that great civilisations have broken down into violence,  
> and their tyrants come, many times before.  
> When open violence appears, to avoid it with honor or choose  
> the least ugly faction; these evils are essential.  
> To keep one’s own integrity, be merciful and uncorrupted  
> and not wish for evil; and not be duped  
> By dreams of universal justice or happiness. These dreams will  
> not be fulfilled.  
> To know this, and know that however ugly the parts appear  
> the whole remains beautiful. A severed hand  
> Is an ugly thing and man dissevered from the earth and stars  
> and his history … for contemplation or in fact …  
> Often appears atrociously ugly. Integrity is wholeness,  
> the greatest beauty is  
> Organic wholeness, the wholeness of life and things, the divine beauty  
> of the universe. Love that, not man  
> Apart from that, or else you will share man’s pitiful confusions,  
> or drown in despair when his days darken.
