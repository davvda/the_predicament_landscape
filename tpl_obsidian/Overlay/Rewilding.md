> **The Peace of Wild Things**
> When despair for the world grows in me
> and I wake in the night at the least sound
> in fear of what my life and my children’s lives might be,
> I go and lie down where the wood drake
> rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
> I come into the peace of wild things
> who do not tax their lives with forethought
> of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
> And I feel above me the day-blind stars
> waiting with their light. For a time  
> I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.
