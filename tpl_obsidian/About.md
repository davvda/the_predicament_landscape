~~Maybe [donate](https://ko-fi.com/punkistpoet) some food to my dog Hilma?~~ I currently have a job so even if I still appreciate donations I would direct you to [donate for me](https://galgosdelsol.org/donate-help/) instead of to me. Or [send me an email](mailto:david@punk.ist)? Or check out [my other project](www.punk.ist) that started all this madness...
